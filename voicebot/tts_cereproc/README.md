# Text-To-Speech service

## Description

This service turns a text message into a voice mssage using [gtts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtts). You'll find how it's done in the [tts.js](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/tts_service/src/routes/tts.js) file.

## How to install it

`npm install` to install all dependencies.

## How to build it

In the [gdo_voicebot](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/tree/master/gdo_voicebot) you'll find a [build bash](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/build.sh) that will build tts and voice-assistant services. To use this bash, run `./build.sh`.

Locally you can execute `npm run build`

## How to check and correct the syntax

In the [gdo_voicebot](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/tree/master/gdo_voicebot) you'll find a [lint bash](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/lint.sh) that will check the integrality of the syntax in each microservice. Execute `./lint.sh` to symply check the syntax and `./lint.sh --fix` to correct syntax errors automaticaly.

Locally you can execute `npm run lint`or`npm run lint:fix`.

## How to run it

Use `npm run start:dev` if you want the server to be refreshed automatically at any modification in the code. Else you can directly use `npm run start`

## How to use it with docker

In the [gdo_voicebot](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/tree/master/gdo_voicebot), you'll find a [docker-compose](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/docker-compose.yml) file. Here you can run `docker-compose up do-voice-tts-service` and that's it.
