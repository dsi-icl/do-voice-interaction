utter_dev_4_4_1_1:
 - text: "You’re a genius!"
utter_dev_4_4_1_2:
 - text: "Aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!"
utter_dev_4_4_1_3:

utter_dev_4_4_1_9:
 - text: "And"
utter_dev_4_4_1_10:
 - text: "No, I know!"
utter_dev_4_4_1_11:
 - text: "I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one."
utter_dev_4_4_1_12:
 - text: "Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself."
utter_dev_4_4_1_13:
 - text: "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get"
utter_dev_4_4_1_14:

utter_dev_5_20_3_2:

utter_dev_7_7_4_1:
 - text: "Yeah, we were…we were just looking around."
utter_dev_7_7_4_2:

utter_dev_7_7_4_3:

utter_dev_7_7_4_4:

utter_dev_7_7_4_5:
 - text: "Uhh…."
utter_dev_7_7_4_6:
 - text: "Ah… Ah…Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?"
utter_dev_7_7_4_7:
 - text: "Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far too progressionist."
utter_dev_7_7_4_8:
 - text: "I find Marion’s views far too progressionist."
utter_dev_7_7_4_9:
 - text: "I’m sorry, who are you?"
utter_dev_7_7_4_10:
 - text: "I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller."
utter_dev_7_7_4_11:
 - text: "Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh—Wait!  Did you write this?"
utter_dev_7_7_4_12:
 - text: "Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!"
utter_dev_7_7_4_13:
 - text: "Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought. You’re…you’re so young."
utter_dev_7_7_4_14:
 - text: "Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
utter_dev_2_7_5_0:
 - text: "You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me."
utter_dev_2_7_5_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_dev_2_7_5_2:
 - text: "I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you."
utter_dev_2_7_5_3:
 - text: "Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
utter_dev_2_7_5_4:
 - text: "The point is I..."
utter_dev_2_7_5_5:
 - text: "I don't need this right now, OK."
utter_dev_2_7_5_6:

utter_dev_2_7_5_7:
 - text: "This ship has sailed."
utter_dev_2_7_5_8:
 - text: "Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
utter_dev_2_7_5_9:
 - text: "Fine."
utter_dev_2_7_5_10:

utter_dev_2_7_5_12:
 - text: "Good."
utter_dev_8_3_6_0:

utter_dev_8_3_6_1:
 - text: "Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something."
utter_dev_8_3_6_2:
 - text: "All in good time my love."
utter_dev_8_3_6_3:
 - text: "All in good time."
utter_dev_8_3_6_4:
 - text: "Oh shoot!"
utter_dev_8_3_6_5:
 - text: "I left my guitar in their apartment."
utter_dev_8_3_6_6:
 - text: "Well you can let me in later."
utter_dev_8_3_6_7:
 - text: "I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you."
utter_dev_8_3_6_8:
 - text: "What?! They took mine to give to you!"
utter_dev_8_3_6_9:
 - text: "Why would they take away our keys?"
utter_dev_8_20_7_0:
 - text: "Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff."
utter_dev_8_20_7_1:
 - text: "Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all."
utter_dev_8_20_7_2:
 - text: "A"
utter_dev_8_20_7_3:
 - text: "No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks."
utter_dev_8_20_7_4:
 - text: "Uh, what?"
utter_dev_8_20_7_5:
 - text: "Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo."
utter_dev_8_20_7_6:
 - text: "What—You’re not serious."
utter_dev_8_20_7_7:
 - text: "I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her."
utter_dev_8_20_7_8:
 - text: "She’ll drive us totally crazy."
utter_dev_8_20_7_9:
 - text: "Hi Ross!"
utter_dev_8_20_7_10:
 - text: "Hi roomie!"
utter_dev_7_19_8_0:
 - text: "Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?"
utter_dev_7_19_8_1:
 - text: "I don’t know!"
utter_dev_7_19_8_2:
 - text: "It’s not like it’s porn!"
utter_dev_7_19_8_3:
 - text: "This is a serious, legitimate movie."
utter_dev_7_19_8_4:
 - text: "And the nudity is really important to the story."
utter_dev_7_19_8_5:
 - text: "That’s what you say about porn."
utter_dev_7_19_8_6:
 - text: "You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back."
utter_dev_7_19_8_7:
 - text: "No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!"
utter_dev_7_19_8_8:
 - text: "Well that’s true."
utter_dev_7_19_8_9:
 - text: "And I am only naked in one scene."
utter_dev_7_19_8_10:
 - text: "Plus it sounds really great."
utter_dev_7_19_8_11:
 - text: "My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl."
utter_dev_7_19_8_12:
 - text: "Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm."
utter_dev_7_19_8_13:
 - text: "So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other."
utter_dev_7_19_8_14:
 - text: "It’s really sweet and-and tender."
utter_dev_6_3_9_0:
 - text: "Hey, what’s up?"
utter_dev_6_3_9_1:
 - text: "Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
utter_dev_6_3_9_2:
 - text: "But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today."
utter_dev_6_3_9_3:
 - text: "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly. Nice!"
utter_dev_6_3_9_4:
 - text: "Yeah?"
utter_dev_6_3_9_5:
 - text: "I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know?"
utter_dev_6_3_9_6:
 - text: "Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me."
utter_dev_6_3_9_7:
 - text: "And what’s more different than me. A guy who’s"
utter_dev_5_20_10_0:
 - text: "So where are we going next?"
utter_dev_5_20_10_1:
 - text: "This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home."
utter_dev_5_20_10_2:
 - text: "Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
utter_dev_5_20_10_3:
 - text: "Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?"
utter_dev_5_20_10_4:
 - text: "It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!"
utter_dev_5_20_10_5:
 - text: "Yeah, no one talks like that!"
utter_dev_5_20_10_6:
 - text: "Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!"
utter_dev_5_20_10_7:
 - text: "Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
utter_dev_5_20_10_8:
 - text: "How do you figure that?"
utter_dev_5_20_10_9:
 - text: "Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
utter_dev_5_19_11_0:
 - text: "I guess so."
utter_dev_5_19_11_1:
 - text: "Here you go. Thank you!"
utter_dev_5_19_11_2:
 - text: "Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
utter_dev_5_19_11_3:
 - text: "Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
utter_dev_5_19_11_4:
 - text: "Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
utter_dev_5_19_11_5:
 - text: "Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it."
utter_dev_5_19_11_6:
 - text: "I know it's in the apartment, but I"
utter_dev_5_19_11_7:
 - text: "Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
utter_dev_5_19_11_8:
 - text: "Tell her to wear her own earrings."
utter_dev_5_19_11_9:
 - text: "These"
utter_dev_5_19_11_10:
 - text: "Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!"
utter_dev_5_19_11_11:
 - text: "Why not?"
utter_dev_5_19_11_12:
 - text: "Because I lose her stuff!"
utter_dev_7_24_12_0:
 - text: "Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?"
utter_dev_7_24_12_1:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_dev_7_24_12_2:
 - text: "What’s going on?"
utter_dev_7_24_12_3:
 - text: "Chandler’s gone again!"
utter_dev_7_24_12_4:
 - text: "Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_0:
 - text: "Okay. You ready to push again?"
utter_dev_5_3_13_1:
 - text: "I already had a baby. Leave me alone."
utter_dev_5_3_13_2:
 - text: "Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_3:
 - text: "Yeah!!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_4:
 - text: "Little Leslie is here!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_5:
 - text: "We got another one!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_6:
 - text: "Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children."
utter_dev_5_3_13_7:
 - text: "How scary is that?"
utter_dev_5_3_13_8:
 - text: "Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_9:
 - text: "All right, he's coming. He's coming!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_10:

utter_dev_5_3_13_11:
 - text: "Chandler's a girl!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_12:
 - text: "Oh God, kindergarten flashback."
utter_dev_5_3_13_13:
 - text: "They musta read the sonogram wrong."
utter_dev_5_3_13_14:
 - text: "Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_15:
 - text: "Chandler's a girl!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_16:
 - text: "Okay, keep saying it!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_17:
 - text: "Am I too late?!"
utter_dev_5_3_13_18:
 - text: "No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes."
utter_dev_5_3_13_19:

utter_dev_5_3_13_20:

utter_dev_8_5_14_5:
 - text: "Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here."
utter_dev_8_5_14_6:
 - text: "Toby don’t."
utter_dev_8_5_14_7:
 - text: "Bob!"
utter_dev_8_5_14_8:
 - text: "Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!"
utter_dev_8_7_15_0:
 - text: "Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!"
utter_dev_8_7_15_1:
 - text: "I know! I found it on the street."
utter_dev_8_7_15_2:
 - text: "Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition."
utter_dev_8_7_15_3:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_dev_8_7_15_4:
 - text: "Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?"
utter_dev_8_7_15_5:
 - text: "I don’t know."
utter_dev_8_7_15_6:
 - text: "It’s moving."
utter_dev_8_7_15_7:
 - text: "Ew."
utter_dev_8_7_15_8:
 - text: "It’s still——It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!"
utter_dev_8_7_15_9:
 - text: "Ooh! Ah! Okay!"
utter_dev_7_5_16_0:
 - text: "Well, I went over to Kyle’s last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing"
utter_dev_7_5_16_1:
 - text: "we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So"
utter_dev_7_5_16_2:
 - text: "Oh just say it Kyle!"
utter_dev_7_5_16_3:
 - text: "We’re gonna give it another try."
utter_dev_7_5_16_4:
 - text: "What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!"
utter_dev_7_5_16_5:
 - text: "I’m gonna work on that."
utter_dev_7_5_16_6:
 - text: "Oh right, because you’re so capable of change."
utter_dev_7_5_16_7:
 - text: "Y’know, he hums when he pees!"
utter_dev_7_5_16_8:
 - text: "I do know."
utter_dev_7_5_16_9:
 - text: "It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
utter_dev_7_5_16_10:
 - text: "We’re so sorry."
utter_dev_7_5_16_11:
 - text: "That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already."
utter_dev_7_5_16_12:
 - text: "Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."
utter_dev_7_5_16_13:
 - text: "Yeah, we’re gonna go."
utter_dev_7_5_16_14:

utter_dev_7_5_16_15:
 - text: "Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to."
utter_dev_7_5_16_16:
 - text: "Yeah, we're better off without them."
utter_dev_7_5_16_17:
 - text: "And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!"
utter_dev_7_5_16_18:
 - text: "Divorced men’s club."
utter_dev_6_5_17_0:
 - text: "Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?"
utter_dev_6_5_17_1:
 - text: "Maybe because you’ve got the keys?"
utter_dev_6_5_17_2:
 - text: "This is totally your fault!"
utter_dev_6_5_17_3:
 - text: "My fault?! You threatened the judge!"
utter_dev_6_5_17_4:
 - text: "Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_0:
 - text: "Phoebe!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_1:
 - text: "Yeah?"
utter_dev_6_22_18_2:
 - text: "Have you seen Chandler?!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_3:
 - text: "No! Why?"
utter_dev_6_22_18_4:
 - text: "The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_5:
 - text: "I know!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_6:
 - text: "How bad is this?"
utter_dev_6_22_18_7:
 - text: "Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_8:
 - text: "I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_9:
 - text: "What are you gonna do?"
utter_dev_6_22_18_10:
 - text: "Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_11:
 - text: "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
utter_dev_6_22_18_12:
 - text: "Rachel said that!"
utter_dev_6_22_18_13:
 - text: "Well Rachel’s not here!"
utter_dev_1_23_19_0:
 - text: "Come on, come on."
utter_dev_1_23_19_1:
 - text: "Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit."
utter_dev_1_23_19_2:
 - text: "This is all your fault."
utter_dev_1_23_19_3:
 - text: "This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?"
utter_dev_1_23_19_4:
 - text: "My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
utter_dev_1_23_19_5:
 - text: "The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have."
utter_dev_1_23_19_6:
 - text: "No no no, believe me."
utter_dev_1_23_19_7:
 - text: "No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?"
utter_dev_1_23_19_8:
 - text: "And you know what the funny thing is?"
utter_dev_1_23_19_9:
 - text: "When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?"
utter_dev_1_23_19_10:
 - text: "Where does that leave me?"
utter_dev_1_23_19_11:
 - text: "You get to be the baby's father."
utter_dev_1_23_19_12:
 - text: "Everyone knows who you are."
utter_dev_1_23_19_13:
 - text: "Who am I?"
utter_dev_1_23_19_14:
 - text: "There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
utter_dev_1_23_19_15:
 - text: "Every day is Lesbian Lover Day."
utter_dev_1_23_19_16:
 - text: "This is so great."
utter_dev_1_23_19_17:
 - text: "You wanna explain that?"
utter_dev_1_23_19_18:
 - text: "I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one."
utter_dev_1_23_19_19:
 - text: "And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most."
utter_dev_1_23_19_20:
 - text: "And it's not even born yet."
utter_dev_1_23_19_21:
 - text: "It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world."
utter_dev_1_23_19_22:
 - text: "I'm sorry, you were fighting."
utter_dev_5_10_20_0:
 - text: "Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out."
utter_dev_5_10_20_1:
 - text: "Hi, how are you doing Kelly?"
utter_dev_5_10_20_2:
 - text: "I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!"
utter_dev_5_10_20_3:
 - text: "It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can"
utter_dev_5_10_20_4:
 - text: "Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!"
utter_dev_5_10_20_5:
 - text: "This is disgusting!"
utter_dev_5_10_20_6:
 - text: "I'm not reading this!"
utter_dev_5_10_20_7:
 - text: "What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!"
utter_dev_1_20_21_0:
 - text: "All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser."
utter_dev_1_20_21_1:
 - text: "I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
utter_dev_1_20_21_2:
 - text: "You know he's gay?"
utter_dev_1_20_21_3:
 - text: "I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?"
utter_dev_1_20_21_4:
 - text: "Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
utter_dev_1_20_21_5:
 - text: "Hi. Hi."
utter_dev_1_20_21_6:
 - text: "What are you doing here?"
utter_dev_1_4_22_0:
 - text: "Well, what?"
utter_dev_1_4_22_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_dev_1_4_22_2:
 - text: "What is it?"
utter_dev_1_4_22_3:
 - text: "That she left you?"
utter_dev_1_4_22_4:
 - text: "That she likes women?"
utter_dev_1_4_22_5:

utter_dev_2_1_25_2:

utter_dev_2_2_26_7:

utter_dev_2_2_26_9:

utter_dev_1_15_29_8:

utter_dev_1_15_29_9:

utter_dev_6_20_30_2:

utter_dev_6_20_30_3:

utter_dev_6_20_30_8:

utter_dev_6_20_30_10:
 - text: "Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
utter_dev_6_20_30_11:
 - text: "Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me."
utter_dev_6_20_30_12:
 - text: "Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed."
utter_dev_6_20_30_13:
 - text: "Fine!"
utter_dev_6_20_30_14:
 - text: "I’ll do it without you!"
utter_dev_6_20_30_15:
 - text: "I don’t need you or anybody else!"
utter_dev_6_20_30_16:
 - text: "I’m gonna make it on my own!"
utter_dev_6_20_30_17:
 - text: "You’ll see!!"
utter_dev_6_20_30_18:
 - text: "You’ll"
utter_dev_9_17_31_0:
 - text: "I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad."
utter_dev_9_17_31_1:
 - text: "I didn't know Ross and you were so close."
utter_dev_9_17_31_2:
 - text: "We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him."
utter_dev_9_17_31_3:
 - text: "I'm sure that would mean a lot to him."
utter_dev_9_17_31_4:
 - text: "And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
utter_dev_9_17_31_5:
 - text: "I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance."
utter_dev_9_17_31_6:
 - text: "But you didn't!"
utter_dev_9_17_31_7:
 - text: "I'm still alive!!"
utter_dev_9_17_31_8:
 - text: "Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you."
utter_dev_9_17_31_9:
 - text: "It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!"
utter_dev_9_17_31_10:
 - text: "I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!"
utter_dev_9_17_31_11:
 - text: "You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!"
utter_dev_9_17_31_12:
 - text: "Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!"
utter_dev_8_22_32_0:
 - text: "We’ll do a quick check."
utter_dev_8_22_32_1:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_dev_8_22_32_2:
 - text: "So, eight days late huh?"
utter_dev_8_22_32_3:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_dev_8_22_32_4:
 - text: "You must be a little uncomfortable."
utter_dev_8_22_32_5:
 - text: "Eh, just a tad."
utter_dev_8_22_32_6:
 - text: "You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way."
utter_dev_8_22_32_7:
 - text: "It still could last a little while longer."
utter_dev_8_22_32_8:
 - text: "If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along."
utter_dev_8_22_32_9:
 - text: "Do them!!"
utter_dev_8_22_32_10:
 - text: "Actually, they’re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective."
utter_dev_8_22_32_11:
 - text: "Well, we are ready to try anything."
utter_dev_8_22_32_12:
 - text: "Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink."
utter_dev_8_22_32_13:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_dev_9_2_33_0:
 - text: "What is wrong with Emma?"
utter_dev_9_2_33_1:
 - text: "Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa."
utter_dev_1_9_34_0:
 - text: "Anytime you're ready."
utter_dev_1_9_34_1:
 - text: "Ok, ok, here we go."
utter_dev_1_9_34_2:
 - text: "Ok, where am I talking to, here?"
utter_dev_1_9_34_3:
 - text: "I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
utter_dev_1_9_34_4:
 - text: "Just aim for the bump."
utter_dev_1_9_34_5:
 - text: "Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes."
utter_dev_1_9_34_6:
 - text: "You know, I, you know, can't do this."
utter_dev_1_9_34_7:
 - text: "Uh, this is too weird."
utter_dev_1_9_34_8:
 - text: "I feel stupid."
utter_dev_1_9_34_9:
 - text: "So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
utter_dev_1_9_34_10:
 - text: "Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
utter_dev_3_12_35_0:
 - text: "Oh, hi. It’s Mark."
utter_dev_3_21_36_0:
 - text: "Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?"
utter_dev_3_21_36_1:
 - text: "Okay, I do."
utter_dev_3_21_36_2:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_dev_3_21_36_3:
 - text: "I really do."
utter_dev_3_21_36_4:
 - text: "Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a cab."
utter_dev_3_21_36_5:
 - text: "Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?"
utter_dev_3_21_36_6:
 - text: "Of course I am. I just have to make a call."
utter_dev_3_21_36_7:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_dev_3_21_36_8:
 - text: "Okay?"
utter_dev_3_21_36_9:
 - text: "Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!"
utter_dev_3_21_36_10:
 - text: "What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?"
utter_dev_3_21_36_11:
 - text: "I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this."
utter_dev_3_24_37_0:
 - text: "Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just..."
utter_dev_3_24_37_1:
 - text: "Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
utter_dev_3_24_37_2:
 - text: "Oh, I can’t watch this."
utter_dev_3_24_37_3:
 - text: "Check it out, he’s winning!  Pete’s winning!"
utter_dev_3_24_37_4:
 - text: "Really?!"
utter_dev_3_24_37_5:
 - text: "No-o-o!!"
utter_dev_3_24_37_6:
 - text: "Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area."
utter_dev_3_24_37_7:
 - text: "Oh! Oh!"
utter_dev_3_24_37_8:
 - text: "Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
utter_dev_3_24_37_9:
 - text: "Well, this is ironic."
utter_dev_3_24_37_10:
 - text: "Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t."
utter_dev_4_2_38_0:
 - text: "Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!"
utter_dev_8_24_39_0:
 - text: "Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?"
utter_dev_8_24_39_1:
 - text: "We could, or we can have sex in it."
utter_dev_8_24_39_2:
 - text: "Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
utter_dev_8_5_40_0:
 - text: "I thought I was a complete idiot."
utter_dev_8_5_40_1:
 - text: "Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him."
utter_dev_8_5_40_2:
 - text: "Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
utter_dev_8_5_40_3:
 - text: "I said no."
utter_dev_8_5_40_4:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_dev_8_5_40_5:
 - text: "What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people."
utter_dev_8_5_40_6:
 - text: "Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
utter_dev_8_5_40_7:
 - text: "I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people."
utter_dev_8_5_40_8:
 - text: "Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?"
utter_dev_8_5_40_9:
 - text: "Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great"
utter_dev_8_5_40_10:
 - text: "Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!"
utter_dev_4_16_41_0:
 - text: "Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go."
utter_dev_4_16_41_1:
 - text: "That’s okay."
utter_dev_4_16_41_2:
 - text: "She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so"
utter_dev_5_1_42_0:
 - text: "Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!"
utter_dev_5_1_42_1:
 - text: "You tell them to wait!"
utter_dev_5_1_42_2:
 - text: "Okay. Wait! Wait!"
utter_dev_5_1_42_3:
 - text: "Emily."
utter_dev_5_1_42_4:
 - text: "Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!"
utter_dev_6_6_43_0:
 - text: "Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?"
utter_dev_6_6_43_1:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_dev_5_17_44_0:
 - text: "I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman."
utter_dev_5_17_44_1:
 - text: "Nevermind!"
utter_dev_5_17_44_2:
 - text: "No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in."
utter_dev_5_17_44_3:
 - text: "Jen."
utter_dev_5_17_44_4:
 - text: "Jen, I know this may sound a little… But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or"
utter_dev_5_17_44_5:
 - text: "Sure! That would be nice."
utter_dev_5_17_44_6:
 - text: "Umm?"
utter_dev_5_17_44_7:
 - text: "Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call."
utter_dev_5_17_44_8:
 - text: "I will give you a call."
utter_dev_5_17_44_9:
 - text: "I'll see you later."
utter_dev_5_17_44_10:
 - text: "Okay!"
utter_dev_5_17_44_11:
 - text: "I forgot my paper."
utter_dev_3_17_45_0:
 - text: "Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
utter_dev_3_17_45_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_dev_3_17_45_2:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_dev_3_17_45_3:
 - text: "Ow!"
utter_dev_3_17_45_4:
 - text: "Aren’t you gonna go?"
utter_dev_3_17_45_5:
 - text: "No. Thank you."
utter_dev_3_17_45_6:
 - text: "No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
utter_dev_3_17_45_7:
 - text: "Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’  Well, if everybody’s going."
utter_dev_3_17_45_8:
 - text: "No, y'know what don’t close it  ‘cause the... keys...are in there."
utter_dev_3_17_45_9:
 - text: "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
utter_dev_3_17_45_10:
 - text: "What’s going on?"
utter_dev_3_17_45_11:
 - text: "My lighter’s in there!"
utter_dev_3_8_46_0:
 - text: "I promise."
utter_dev_3_8_46_1:
 - text: "Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit."
utter_dev_3_8_46_2:
 - text: "Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
utter_dev_3_8_46_3:
 - text: "No, no he’s not."
utter_dev_3_8_46_4:
 - text: "You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
utter_dev_3_8_46_5:
 - text: "What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?"
utter_dev_3_8_46_6:
 - text: "Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not."
utter_dev_3_8_46_7:
 - text: "Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him."
utter_dev_3_8_46_8:
 - text: "It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him."
utter_dev_3_8_46_9:
 - text: "Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe"
utter_dev_3_17_47_0:
 - text: "Hey, what are you doing here?"
utter_dev_3_17_47_1:
 - text: "Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of"
utter_dev_3_17_47_2:

utter_dev_3_17_47_5:
 - text: "Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
utter_dev_3_17_47_6:
 - text: "Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary."
utter_dev_3_17_47_7:
 - text: "Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
utter_dev_3_17_47_8:
 - text: "It’s not that kind of anniversary."
utter_dev_3_17_47_9:
 - text: "Ah!  Oh."
utter_dev_3_17_47_10:
 - text: "Sooo!! Anyway..."
utter_dev_3_8_48_0:
 - text: "Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?"
utter_dev_3_8_48_1:

utter_dev_8_18_63_1:
 - text: "Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible."
utter_dev_8_18_63_2:
 - text: "But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?"
utter_dev_8_18_63_3:
 - text: "It was really fun being married to you tonight."
utter_dev_8_18_63_4:

utter_dev_8_18_63_14:
 - text: "It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
utter_dev_8_18_63_15:
 - text: "Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too."
utter_dev_8_18_63_16:
 - text: "It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night"
utter_dev_8_18_63_17:
 - text: "Goodnight"
utter_dev_8_18_63_18:

utter_dev_7_23_66_0:
 - text: "Oh my God! Chandler just left though!"
utter_dev_7_23_66_1:
 - text: "Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk."
utter_dev_7_23_66_2:
 - text: "Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry."
utter_dev_7_23_66_3:
 - text: "I think it means he freaked out and left!"
utter_dev_7_23_66_4:
 - text: "Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!"
utter_dev_7_23_66_5:
 - text: "Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?"
utter_dev_7_23_66_6:

utter_dev_7_8_69_13:
 - text: "It just doesn't matter how I feel."
utter_dev_7_8_69_14:

utter_dev_7_8_69_16:
 - text: "Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out."
utter_dev_7_8_69_17:

 - text: "Where?"
utter_dev_2_1_90_4:
 - text: "At his apartment. Is this juice?"
utter_dev_2_1_90_5:
 - text: "Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
utter_dev_2_1_90_6:
 - text: "Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
utter_dev_2_2_91_0:
 - text: "I licked my arm, what?"
utter_dev_2_2_91_1:
 - text: "It's breast milk."
utter_dev_2_2_91_2:
 - text: "So?"
utter_dev_2_2_91_3:
 - text: "Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
utter_dev_2_2_91_4:
 - text: "What is the big deal?"
utter_dev_2_2_91_5:
 - text: "What did you just do?"
utter_dev_2_2_91_6:
 - text: "Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
utter_dev_2_2_91_7:
 - text: "You won't even taste it?"
utter_dev_2_2_91_8:
 - text: "No!"
utter_dev_2_2_91_9:
 - text: "Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?"
utter_dev_2_2_91_10:
 - text: "Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it."
utter_dev_6_11_92_0:
 - text: "Aww!"
utter_dev_6_11_92_1:
 - text: "Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new……old sheet?"
utter_dev_6_11_92_2:

utter_dev_6_11_92_8:
 - text: "Oh my God, Phoebe,"
utter_dev_6_11_92_9:
 - text: "Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!"
utter_dev_6_11_92_10:
 - text: "Well this doesn’t even smell like opium."
utter_dev_6_11_92_11:
 - text: "Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way."
utter_dev_2_1_93_0:
 - text: "How is she?"
utter_dev_2_1_93_1:
 - text: "It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
utter_dev_2_1_93_2:
 - text: "How's the hair?"
utter_dev_2_1_93_3:
 - text: "I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good."
utter_dev_2_1_93_4:
 - text: "I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
utter_dev_2_1_93_5:
 - text: "Can we see her?"
utter_dev_2_1_93_6:
 - text: "Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in."
utter_dev_2_1_93_7:
 - text: "How're you doing?"
utter_dev_2_2_94_0:
 - text: "Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike."
utter_dev_2_2_94_1:
 - text: "Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it."
utter_dev_2_2_94_2:
 - text: "That would be no."
utter_dev_2_2_94_3:
 - text: "Come on. It doesn't taste bad."
utter_dev_2_2_94_4:
 - text: "Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
utter_dev_2_2_94_5:
 - text: "Cantaloupe juice."
utter_dev_2_2_94_6:
 - text: "Exactly."
utter_dev_2_2_94_7:
 - text: "You've tasted it? You've tasted it."
utter_dev_2_2_94_8:
 - text: "Uh huh."
utter_dev_2_2_94_9:
 - text: "Oh, you've tasted it."
utter_dev_2_2_94_10:
 - text: "You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
utter_dev_2_2_94_11:
 - text: "Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel."
utter_dev_8_4_95_0:
 - text: "I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number."
utter_dev_8_4_95_1:
 - text: "Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either."
utter_dev_8_4_95_2:
 - text: "Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names."
utter_dev_8_4_95_3:
 - text: "Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
utter_dev_8_4_95_4:
 - text: "Regina Philange."
utter_dev_8_4_95_5:

utter_dev_8_4_95_6:
 - text: "I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
utter_dev_8_4_95_7:
 - text: "I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!"
utter_dev_8_4_95_8:
 - text: "Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!"
utter_dev_8_4_95_9:
 - text: "Well maybe it was all of your questions."
utter_dev_8_4_95_10:
 - text: "What about my questions?"
utter_dev_8_24_96_0:
 - text: "No, I’m sorry. It’s just my foot itches like crazy."
utter_dev_8_24_96_1:
 - text: "Oh, I’ll get it."
utter_dev_8_24_96_2:
 - text: "Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me."
utter_dev_8_24_96_3:
 - text: "Relax, it’s not like we’re forking."
utter_dev_3_20_97_0:
 - text: "Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!"

utter_dev_3_20_97_4:
 - text: "I know!!!"
utter_dev_3_20_97_5:
 - text: "So, I’m here, ready to play."
utter_dev_3_20_97_6:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_dev_3_20_97_7:
 - text: "I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha."
utter_dev_3_20_97_8:
 - text: "What’s this?"
utter_dev_3_20_97_9:
 - text: "That’s a dog, every house should have a dog."
utter_dev_3_20_97_10:
 - text: "Not one that can pee on the roof."
utter_dev_3_20_97_11:
 - text: "Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
utter_dev_3_20_97_12:
 - text: "And is this in case the house sneezes?"
utter_dev_3_20_97_13:
 - text: "No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic."
utter_dev_3_20_97_14:
 - text: "I don’t want a ghost."
utter_dev_3_20_97_15:
 - text: "Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
utter_dev_3_20_97_16:
 - text: "Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen."
utter_dev_3_20_97_17:
 - text: "Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government."
utter_dev_3_20_97_18:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_dev_3_20_97_19:
 - text: "Hello."
utter_dev_3_20_97_20:
 - text: "I need to talk to you!"
utter_dev_3_20_97_21:
 - text: "Sure, what’s up?"
utter_dev_3_12_98_0:
 - text: "All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it."
utter_dev_3_12_98_1:
 - text: "Please, I'm not going for anything."
utter_dev_3_12_98_2:
 - text: "Well, if you don't, I will."
utter_dev_3_12_98_3:
 - text: "Would you please go?"
utter_dev_3_12_98_4:
 - text: "I would!"
utter_dev_3_20_99_0:
 - text: "Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
utter_dev_3_20_99_1:
 - text: "Uh-huh."
utter_dev_3_20_99_2:

utter_dev_3_20_99_3:

utter_dev_3_20_99_5:
 - text: "Ahhhh!!"
utter_dev_3_20_99_6:
 - text: "Hey, my Father’s house does that!"
utter_dev_3_20_99_7:
 - text: "O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
utter_dev_3_20_99_8:
 - text: "Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
utter_dev_1_1_100_0:
 - text: "Okay. It’s Emma."
utter_dev_8_4_101_0:
 - text: "Emma!  See? I don’t want it."
utter_dev_1_2_102_0:
 - text: "Take it."
utter_dev_1_2_102_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_dev_8_24_103_0:
 - text: "It’s clearly an Emma."
utter_dev_8_24_103_1:
 - text: "Oh honey, but you love that name."
utter_dev_8_24_103_2:
 - text: "Yeah, but I love you more."
utter_dev_8_24_103_3:
 - text: "Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing."
utter_dev_8_24_103_4:
 - text: "So I’m screwed."
utter_dev_5_8_104_0:
 - text: "Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, Quack, quack! I’m happy all the time!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_1:
 - text: "Nice try."
utter_dev_5_8_104_2:
 - text: "Wait, wait, wait!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_3:
 - text: "Look, Monica"
utter_dev_5_8_104_4:
 - text: "Look!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_5:
 - text: "This is not going to work."
utter_dev_5_8_104_6:
 - text: "I bet this will work!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_7:
 - text: "You are so great! I love you!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_8:
 - text: "What?"
utter_dev_5_8_104_9:
 - text: "Nothing! I said, I said You're so great and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_10:
 - text: "You said you loved me! I can't believe this!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_11:
 - text: "No I didn't!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_12:
 - text: "Yes, you did!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_13:
 - text: "No I didn't!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_14:
 - text: "You love me!"
utter_dev_5_8_104_15:
 - text: "No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
utter_dev_8_4_105_0:
 - text: "Hello Greg?"
utter_dev_8_4_105_1:
 - text: "Hi, this is Monica from the plane?"
utter_dev_8_4_105_2:
 - text: "Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5…   That is their old number!"
utter_dev_8_4_105_3:
 - text: "Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!"
utter_dev_8_4_105_4:
 - text: "Jenny! That is so Jenny!"
utter_dev_8_4_105_5:
 - text: "Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together?"

utter_dev_8_4_105_11:
 - text: "We are good, interesting, funny people with"
utter_dev_6_18_106_0:
 - text: "Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?"
utter_dev_6_18_106_1:
 - text: "Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."
utter_dev_6_18_106_2:
 - text: "What’s a Movement class?"
utter_dev_6_18_106_3:
 - text: "It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime."
utter_dev_6_18_106_4:
 - text: "Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!"
utter_dev_6_18_106_5:
 - text: "Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years."
utter_dev_6_20_107_0:
 - text: "I am."
utter_dev_6_20_107_1:
 - text: "Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor."
utter_dev_6_20_107_2:
 - text: "You really think so?"
utter_dev_6_20_107_3:
 - text: "Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!"
utter_dev_5_3_108_0:
 - text: "Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the"
utter_dev_5_3_108_1:

 - text: "Ow!"
utter_dev_5_3_108_7:
 - text: "Ooh!"
utter_dev_5_3_108_8:
 - text: "Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it."
utter_dev_5_3_108_9:
 - text: "Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?"
utter_dev_5_3_108_10:
 - text: "Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!"
utter_dev_5_3_108_11:
 - text: "Hi!"
utter_dev_5_3_108_12:
 - text: "That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!"
utter_dev_5_3_108_13:
 - text: "Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time."
utter_dev_5_3_108_14:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_dev_5_9_109_0:
 - text: "I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey."
utter_dev_5_9_109_1:
 - text: "But sadly I could not be enticed."
utter_dev_5_9_109_2:
 - text: "Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!"
utter_dev_5_9_109_3:
 - text: "I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants."
utter_dev_5_9_109_4:
 - text: "Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not."
utter_dev_5_9_109_5:
 - text: "Eh?"
utter_dev_5_9_109_6:
 - text: "All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket."
utter_dev_5_9_109_7:
 - text: "I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs."
utter_dev_6_11_110_0:
 - text: "Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing."
utter_dev_6_11_110_1:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_dev_6_11_110_2:
 - text: "Well, what period is it from?"
utter_dev_6_11_110_3:
 - text: "Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?"
utter_dev_6_11_110_4:
 - text: "Yes, yes I do."
utter_dev_6_11_110_5:
 - text: "God, oh it’s just perfect!"
utter_dev_6_11_110_6:
 - text: "I bet it has a great story behind it too."
utter_dev_6_11_110_7:
 - text: "Did they tell you anything?"
utter_dev_6_11_110_8:
 - text: "Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains."
utter_dev_6_11_110_9:
 - text: "White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place."
utter_dev_3_25_111_0:
 - text: "So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?"
utter_dev_3_25_111_1:
 - text: "Huh?"
utter_dev_3_25_111_2:
 - text: "I saw you checking me out during the game last night."
utter_dev_4_1_112_0:
 - text: "I, umm, shut up!"
utter_dev_4_1_112_1:
 - text: "“Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!"
utter_dev_4_1_112_2:
 - text: "Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?"
utter_dev_4_1_112_3:
 - text: "Noooo!!"
utter_dev_4_1_112_4:
 - text: "All right, hang on!"
utter_dev_6_2_113_0:
 - text: "Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
utter_dev_6_2_113_1:
 - text: "But I"
utter_dev_6_2_113_2:
 - text: "No-no, wait!"
utter_dev_6_2_113_3:
 - text: "Just let me finish, okay?"
utter_dev_6_2_113_4:
 - text: "This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want."
utter_dev_6_2_113_5:
 - text: "And it"
utter_dev_6_2_113_6:
 - text: "It is? Really?"
utter_dev_6_2_113_7:
 - text: "Yeah, sweetie."
utter_dev_6_2_113_8:
 - text: "I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?"
utter_dev_6_2_113_9:
 - text: "No."
utter_dev_6_2_113_10:
 - text: "What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much!"
utter_dev_6_2_113_11:
 - text: "I’m gonna miss you!"
utter_dev_6_2_113_12:
 - text: "I mean it’s the end of an era!"
utter_dev_6_2_113_13:
 - text: "I know!"
utter_test_3_19_0_0:
 - text: "Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?"
utter_test_3_19_0_1:
 - text: "Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’"
utter_test_3_19_0_2:
 - text: "Y'know what?"
utter_test_1_23_1_0:
 - text: "Come on, Lydia, you can do it."
utter_test_1_23_1_1:
 - text: "Push!"
utter_test_1_23_1_2:
 - text: "Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder."
utter_test_1_23_1_3:
 - text: "Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!"
utter_test_1_23_1_4:
 - text: "Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho."
utter_test_1_23_1_5:
 - text: "Let's—  I was just—yeah, right."
utter_test_1_23_1_6:
 - text: "Push!"
utter_test_1_23_1_7:
 - text: "Push!"
utter_test_5_16_2_0:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_test_5_16_2_1:
 - text: "Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?"
utter_test_5_16_2_2:
 - text: "Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."
utter_test_5_16_2_3:
 - text: "Okay, go left. Left! Left!"
utter_test_5_16_2_4:
 - text: "Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!"
utter_test_5_16_2_5:
 - text: "Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!"
utter_test_5_16_2_6:
 - text: "Straight up over your head!"
utter_test_5_16_2_7:
 - text: "You can do it!"
utter_test_5_16_2_8:
 - text: "You can do it!"
utter_test_5_16_2_9:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_test_5_16_2_10:
 - text: "You got it?"
utter_test_5_15_3_0:
 - text: "Oh, okay, I get it."
utter_test_5_15_3_1:
 - text: "No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even"
utter_test_5_15_3_2:
 - text: "Howard's the"
utter_test_5_15_3_3:
 - text: "Yes but too me he's just, man."
utter_test_5_15_3_4:
 - text: "Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building."
utter_test_5_15_3_5:
 - text: "Ugh, can you believe that guy!"
utter_test_5_15_3_6:
 - text: "Yeah. I really like his glasses."
utter_test_4_14_4_0:
 - text: "Ohh!"
utter_test_4_14_4_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_test_4_14_4_2:
 - text: "It kicked! I think the baby kicked!"
utter_test_4_14_4_3:
 - text: "Oh my God!"
utter_test_4_14_4_4:
 - text: "Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted."
utter_test_4_14_4_5:
 - text: "Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!"
utter_test_4_14_4_6:
 - text: "Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!"
utter_test_4_14_4_7:
 - text: "Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time!"
utter_test_4_14_4_8:
 - text: "They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it."
utter_test_4_20_5_0:
 - text: "You’re coming on to the entire room!  I’m Chandler."
utter_test_4_20_5_1:
 - text: "Hi."
utter_test_4_20_5_2:
 - text: "Hi."
utter_test_4_20_5_3:
 - text: "You mind if I"
utter_test_4_20_5_4:
 - text: "No, please."
utter_test_4_20_5_5:
 - text: "So uh, what are you in for?"
utter_test_4_20_5_6:
 - text: "I talk in my sleep."
utter_test_4_20_5_7:
 - text: "What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep."
utter_test_4_20_5_8:
 - text: "So why don’t you give me your number?"
utter_test_3_16_6_0:
 - text: "Previously on Friends."
utter_test_3_16_6_1:
 - text: "I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling."
utter_test_3_16_6_2:
 - text: "Oh?!"
utter_test_3_24_7_0:
 - text: "Yeah, but without the costumes."
utter_test_3_24_7_1:
 - text: "Oh."
utter_test_3_24_7_2:
 - text: "And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal."
utter_test_3_24_7_3:
 - text: "Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re"
utter_test_3_24_7_4:
 - text: "So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?"
utter_test_3_24_7_5:
 - text: "Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
utter_test_3_24_7_6:
 - text: "What’s fish hooking?"
utter_test_3_24_7_7:
 - text: "Huh, what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
utter_test_3_24_7_8:
 - text: "What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath."
utter_test_2_5_8_0:
 - text: "Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name."
utter_test_2_5_8_1:
 - text: "Well, that makes me feel so good."
utter_test_2_5_8_2:
 - text: "It was just so awkward and bumpy."
utter_test_2_5_8_3:
 - text: "Bumpy?"
utter_test_2_5_8_4:
 - text: "Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with."
utter_test_2_5_8_5:
 - text: "And uh maybe you have to get used to it."
utter_test_2_5_8_6:
 - text: "Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?"
utter_test_6_18_9_0:
 - text: "Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!"
utter_test_6_18_9_1:
 - text: "Oh well, it’s not so bad."
utter_test_6_18_9_2:
 - text: "Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms."
utter_test_6_18_9_3:
 - text: "Oh!"
utter_test_6_18_9_4:
 - text: "My God!"
utter_test_6_18_9_5:
 - text: "Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?"
utter_test_6_18_9_6:
 - text: "Excuse me?"
utter_test_6_18_9_7:
 - text: "Joey! He’s working!  You would look"
utter_test_6_18_9_8:
 - text: "Oh, how bad is it?"
utter_test_6_18_9_9:
 - text: "Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do"
utter_test_6_18_9_10:
 - text: "How’s your room Rach?"
utter_test_6_18_9_11:
 - text: "Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater."
utter_test_6_18_9_12:
 - text: "Isn’t that mine?"
utter_test_6_18_9_13:
 - text: "Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!"
utter_test_6_18_9_14:
 - text: "So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?"
utter_test_6_18_9_15:
 - text: "Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am"
utter_test_6_18_9_16:
 - text: "Yes, they can stay with us."
utter_test_6_18_9_17:
 - text: "Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?"
utter_test_6_20_10_0:
 - text: "There’s just so much pressure."
utter_test_6_20_10_1:
 - text: "I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different."
utter_test_6_20_10_2:
 - text: "I don’t know if you’d understand."
utter_test_6_20_10_3:
 - text: "Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs."
utter_test_7_24_11_0:
 - text: "Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!"
utter_test_7_24_11_1:
 - text: "I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time."
utter_test_7_24_11_2:
 - text: "So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on."
utter_test_7_24_11_3:
 - text: "Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that."
utter_test_7_24_11_4:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_test_6_3_12_0:
 - text: "What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!"
utter_test_6_3_12_1:
 - text: "Ross, we can handle this."
utter_test_6_3_12_2:
 - text: "Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly."
utter_test_6_3_12_3:
 - text: "I mean, enough of the silliness!"
utter_test_6_3_12_4:
 - text: "Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!"
utter_test_6_3_12_5:
 - text: "Okay-okay!"
utter_test_6_3_12_6:
 - text: "Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together."
utter_test_6_3_12_7:
 - text: "Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?"
utter_test_6_3_12_8:
 - text: "That is so silly."
utter_test_6_3_12_9:
 - text: "Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"
utter_test_6_3_12_10:
 - text: "Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
utter_test_6_3_12_11:
 - text: "Love is the best medicine."
utter_test_6_3_12_12:
 - text: "That’s laughter."
utter_test_6_3_12_13:
 - text: "Why do you do it?"
utter_test_6_3_12_14:
 - text: "I don’t know."
utter_test_6_3_12_15:
 - text: "Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
utter_test_6_3_12_16:
 - text: "Yeah, I do."
utter_test_6_3_12_17:
 - text: "And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?"
utter_test_6_3_12_18:
 - text: "Yes."
utter_test_6_3_12_19:
 - text: "Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!"
utter_test_1_13_13_0:

utter_test_1_13_13_2:
 - text: "Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
utter_test_1_13_13_3:
 - text: "You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
utter_test_1_13_13_4:
 - text: "Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic."
utter_test_1_13_13_5:
 - text: "Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!"
utter_test_1_13_13_6:
 - text: "Define me!"
utter_test_1_13_13_7:
 - text: "Love me, I need love!"
utter_test_6_4_14_0:

utter_test_6_4_14_3:

utter_test_6_4_14_7:
 - text: "Hey-hey-hey!"
utter_test_6_4_14_8:

utter_test_6_4_14_9:
 - text: "We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back."
utter_test_6_4_14_10:
 - text: "Oh, all right."
utter_test_5_20_15_0:
 - text: "Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you."
utter_test_5_20_15_1:
 - text: "Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood."
utter_test_5_20_15_2:
 - text: "Okay!"
utter_test_5_20_15_3:
 - text: "Bye!"
utter_test_5_20_15_4:

utter_test_5_20_15_5:
 - text: "Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!"
utter_test_4_10_16_0:
 - text: "Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
utter_test_4_10_16_1:
 - text: "Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey."
utter_test_4_10_16_2:
 - text: "Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
utter_test_4_10_16_3:
 - text: "Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday."
utter_test_4_10_16_4:
 - text: "There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!"
utter_test_4_10_16_5:
 - text: "Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers."
utter_test_4_10_16_6:
 - text: "Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?"
utter_test_4_10_16_7:
 - text: "Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?"
utter_test_4_10_16_8:
 - text: "Because we can remember them."
utter_test_4_10_16_9:
 - text: "Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?"
utter_test_3_7_17_0:
 - text: "Hey. When you guys were kids and you played"
utter_test_3_7_17_1:
 - text: "I was always Joanne."
utter_test_3_7_17_2:
 - text: "Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?"
utter_test_3_7_17_3:
 - text: "Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!"
utter_test_3_7_17_4:
 - text: "Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!"
utter_test_3_7_17_5:
 - text: "Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine."
utter_test_3_7_17_6:
 - text: "What a wank!"
utter_test_3_7_17_7:
 - text: "Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses."
utter_test_3_7_17_8:
 - text: "I know!"
utter_test_3_7_17_9:
 - text: "And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves."
utter_test_3_7_17_10:
 - text: "And I’m appalled for you by the way."
utter_test_3_7_17_11:
 - text: "You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone."
utter_test_3_7_17_12:
 - text: "Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food."
utter_test_3_7_17_13:
 - text: "Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
utter_test_3_7_17_14:
 - text: "Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
utter_test_3_7_17_15:
 - text: "Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
utter_test_3_7_17_16:
 - text: "I’m, I’m freaking out!"
utter_test_3_7_17_17:
 - text: "Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have!"
utter_test_3_7_17_18:
 - text: "All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something."
utter_test_3_7_17_19:
 - text: "Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?"
utter_test_3_7_17_20:
 - text: "Um. yeah."
utter_test_3_7_17_21:
 - text: "I am"
utter_test_3_7_17_22:
 - text: "All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay."
utter_test_3_7_17_23:
 - text: "So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
utter_test_3_7_17_24:
 - text: "Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work."
utter_test_3_7_17_25:
 - text: "Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here."
utter_test_3_7_17_26:
 - text: "Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!"
utter_test_3_7_17_27:
 - text: "Like me tiny doctor!’"
utter_test_3_7_17_28:
 - text: "Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?"
utter_test_3_7_17_29:
 - text: "Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along."
utter_test_3_7_17_30:
 - text: "Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay."
utter_test_3_7_17_31:
 - text: "Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!"
utter_test_3_7_17_32:
 - text: "Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels."
utter_test_6_1_18_0:
 - text: "Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?"
utter_test_6_1_18_1:
 - text: "All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
utter_test_6_1_18_2:
 - text: "Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay."
utter_test_1_1_19_0:
 - text: "Really? A purse?"
utter_test_5_13_20_0:
 - text: "It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag."
utter_test_5_13_20_1:
 - text: "It looks like a women's purse."
utter_test_5_13_20_2:
 - text: "No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,"
utter_test_5_13_20_3:
 - text: "See look,"
utter_test_5_13_20_4:
 - text: "Exactly! Unisex!"
utter_test_5_13_20_5:
 - text: "Maybe you need sex."
utter_test_5_13_20_6:
 - text: "No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex."
utter_test_5_13_20_7:
 - text: "Well, I ain't gonna say no to that."
utter_test_2_4_21_0:
 - text: "So, um, have you told your parents?"
utter_test_2_4_21_1:
 - text: "No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . ."
utter_test_2_4_21_2:
 - text: "Here you go."
utter_test_2_4_21_3:
 - text: "You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who."
utter_test_2_4_21_4:
 - text: "no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better."
utter_test_2_4_21_5:
 - text: "I love you Phoebe."
utter_test_2_4_21_6:
 - text: "So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously."

utter_test_5_5_22_4:

utter_test_5_5_22_5:
 - text: "What?"
utter_test_5_5_22_6:
 - text: "Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
utter_test_5_5_22_7:
 - text: "Why, exactly?"
utter_test_5_5_22_8:
 - text: "Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
utter_test_5_5_22_9:
 - text: "Chandler that's crazy!"
utter_test_5_5_22_10:
 - text: "If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!"
utter_test_5_5_22_11:
 - text: "So, this isn't over?"
utter_test_5_5_22_12:
 - text: "You are so cute!"
utter_test_5_5_22_13:
 - text: "No."
utter_test_5_5_22_14:
 - text: "No, it was a fight."
utter_test_5_5_22_15:
 - text: "You deal with it and move on!"
utter_test_5_5_22_16:
 - text: "It's nothing to freak out about."
utter_test_5_5_22_17:
 - text: "Really? Okay. Great!"
utter_test_5_5_22_18:
 - text: "Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!"
utter_test_5_5_22_19:

utter_test_3_21_25_0:

utter_test_3_21_25_1:

utter_test_3_21_25_9:
 - text: "Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
utter_test_3_21_25_10:
 - text: "Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like."
utter_test_3_21_25_11:
 - text: "You like it right?"
utter_test_3_21_25_12:

utter_test_8_23_28_6:
 - text: "It’s kind of embarrassing."
utter_test_8_23_28_7:
 - text: "Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual."
utter_test_8_23_28_8:
 - text: "How about you?"
utter_test_8_23_28_9:
 - text: "Car accident."
utter_test_8_23_28_10:

utter_test_9_19_29_3:

utter_test_3_3_30_4:
 - text: "Ross's what?"
utter_test_3_3_30_5:

utter_test_4_13_31_0:

utter_test_3_25_32_11:
 - text: "Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way."
utter_test_3_25_32_12:

utter_test_9_2_33_1:
 - text: "Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!"
utter_test_9_2_33_2:

utter_test_9_2_33_3:

utter_test_9_2_33_10:
 - text: "Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!"
utter_test_6_15_34_0:
 - text: "Well, you’re not."
utter_test_6_15_34_1:
 - text: "Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!"
utter_test_6_15_34_2:
 - text: "Yeah I can!  And don’t think I don’t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!"

utter_test_6_15_34_15:
 - text: "There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!"
utter_test_6_15_34_16:
 - text: "Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever"
utter_test_6_15_34_17:
 - text: "Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!"
utter_test_6_15_34_18:

utter_test_3_1_37_0:
 - text: "So, I hear, you hate me!"
utter_test_3_1_37_1:
 - text: "I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
utter_test_3_1_37_2:
 - text: "A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me."
utter_test_3_1_37_3:
 - text: "And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there..."
utter_test_3_1_37_4:
 - text: "All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey."
utter_test_3_1_37_5:
 - text: "So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together."
utter_test_3_1_37_6:
 - text: "But what does that gonna do..."
utter_test_3_1_37_7:

 - text: "Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud."
utter_test_3_7_38_2:

utter_test_4_22_53_8:

utter_test_5_23_55_2:
 - text: "Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?"

 - text: "Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later."
utter_test_8_12_119_0:
 - text: "Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on"
utter_test_8_12_119_1:
 - text: "Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!"
utter_test_8_12_119_2:
 - text: "They’re all Chandler."
utter_test_8_12_119_3:
 - text: "Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!"
utter_test_8_12_119_4:
 - text: "I did.  But it came at a price."
utter_test_8_12_119_5:
 - text: "But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this."
utter_test_8_12_119_6:
 - text: "Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!"
utter_test_6_3_120_0:
 - text: "Sure!"
utter_test_6_3_120_1:
 - text: "Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?"
utter_test_6_3_120_2:
 - text: "With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!"
utter_test_6_3_120_3:
 - text: "And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!"
utter_test_6_3_120_4:
 - text: "Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much."
utter_test_6_3_120_5:
 - text: "Well, I like that idea."
utter_test_6_3_120_6:
 - text: "Obviously!"
utter_test_6_3_120_7:
 - text: "I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?"
utter_test_6_3_120_8:
 - text: "I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like"
utter_test_6_3_120_9:
 - text: "No."
utter_test_6_3_120_10:
 - text: "Okay so you mean no as in, Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."
utter_test_6_3_120_11:
 - text: "Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."
utter_test_6_3_120_12:
 - text: "So, that’s it?"
utter_test_6_3_120_13:
 - text: "I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques."
utter_test_6_3_120_14:
 - text: "Which is why"
utter_test_6_3_120_15:
 - text: "What do you have against the beautiful guest room?"
utter_test_6_3_120_16:
 - text: "I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
utter_test_6_3_120_17:
 - text: "Are you mocking me?"
utter_test_6_3_120_18:
 - text: "No, I’m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room."

utter_test_9_23_122_0:

utter_test_9_23_122_1:
 - text: "Why?"
utter_test_9_23_122_2:
 - text: "I don't know."
utter_test_9_23_122_3:

utter_test_8_5_123_1:
 - text: "But"
utter_test_8_5_123_2:
 - text: "No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
utter_test_8_5_123_3:
 - text: "Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today."
utter_test_8_5_123_4:
 - text: "Why not?!"
utter_test_8_5_123_5:
 - text: "Because I’m dumping him today."
utter_test_8_5_123_6:
 - text: "What?! You said he was sweet!"
utter_test_8_5_123_7:
 - text: "He"
utter_test_8_5_123_8:
 - text: "Just don’t pick up your phone."
utter_test_8_5_123_9:
 - text: "Then he comes over!  I’m so worried about you. Uck! Be a man!"
utter_test_8_5_123_10:
 - text: "What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?"
utter_test_8_5_123_11:
 - text: "You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself."
utter_test_8_5_123_12:
 - text: "Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
utter_test_8_5_123_13:
 - text: "Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill"
utter_test_8_5_123_14:
 - text: "Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!"
utter_test_8_5_123_15:
 - text: "Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch."
utter_test_4_15_124_0:
 - text: "This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen."
utter_test_4_15_124_1:

utter_test_4_15_124_2:
 - text: "Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?"
utter_test_4_15_124_3:
 - text: "Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
utter_test_4_15_124_4:
 - text: "Oh. Well, I’ll right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen."
utter_test_4_15_124_5:
 - text: "Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."
utter_test_4_15_124_6:
 - text: "Chandler?"
utter_test_4_15_124_7:

 - text: "There you are!"
utter_test_4_15_124_11:
 - text: "There you are!"
utter_test_4_15_124_12:
 - text: "I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
utter_test_4_15_124_13:
 - text: "No! No! I wanna see you take-off."
utter_test_4_15_124_14:
 - text: "Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"

utter_test_6_17_127_2:
 - text: "Ohh,"
utter_test_6_17_127_3:
 - text: "Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to"

utter_test_8_7_128_7:

utter_test_3_12_129_0:

utter_test_3_12_129_1:

utter_test_4_21_130_0:
 - text: "So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?"
utter_test_4_21_130_1:
 - text: "Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years."
utter_test_4_21_130_2:
 - text: "Yeah, invite him?"
utter_test_4_21_130_3:

utter_test_4_21_130_5:

 - text: "Sure. Why not?"
utter_test_4_21_130_8:
 - text: "Really?"
utter_test_4_21_130_9:
 - text: "Yeah?"
utter_test_4_21_130_10:
 - text: "I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there."
utter_test_4_21_130_11:
 - text: "Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?"
utter_test_4_21_130_12:
 - text: "Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you."
utter_test_4_21_130_13:

utter_test_8_23_132_0:
 - text: "Could you help me with something?"
utter_test_8_23_132_1:
 - text: "The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair."
utter_test_8_23_132_2:
 - text: "And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive."
utter_test_8_23_132_3:

utter_test_8_23_132_12:
 - text: "Hands!"
utter_test_8_23_132_13:
 - text: "It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in."
utter_test_8_23_132_14:

utter_test_7_11_137_14:
 - text: "I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!"
utter_test_6_7_138_0:
 - text: "Okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
utter_test_6_7_138_1:

utter_test_5_10_140_9:
 - text: "Wait a second, I could star in it!"
utter_test_5_10_140_10:
 - text: "Or that."
utter_test_5_10_140_11:
 - text: "I can't write!"
utter_test_5_10_140_12:

utter_test_5_10_140_15:

utter_test_6_1_141_1:

utter_test_6_1_141_3:
 - text: "Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way."
utter_test_6_1_141_4:
 - text: "Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star."
utter_test_3_6_142_0:
 - text: "Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good."
utter_test_3_6_142_1:
 - text: "All right."
utter_test_7_6_143_0:
 - text: "As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do."
utter_test_7_6_143_1:
 - text: "Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize."
utter_test_7_6_143_2:
 - text: "I would really love it if I could do both."
utter_test_7_6_143_3:

utter_test_5_21_145_3:

utter_test_5_21_145_4:

utter_test_5_21_145_5:
 - text: "What's up?"
utter_test_5_21_145_6:
 - text: "Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk."

utter_test_5_21_145_10:
 - text: "Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy."
utter_test_5_21_145_11:

utter_test_6_3_146_0:
 - text: "Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff."
utter_test_6_3_146_1:
 - text: "Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in."
utter_test_6_3_146_2:
 - text: "What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?"
utter_test_6_3_146_3:
 - text: "No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room."
utter_test_6_3_146_4:
 - text: "What?! Over a stupid room!"
utter_test_6_3_146_5:
 - text: "Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!"
utter_test_6_3_146_6:

utter_test_3_2_151_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_test_3_2_151_2:
 - text: "Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you."
utter_test_3_2_151_3:
 - text: "Um, can you roll your tongue?"
utter_test_3_5_152_0:
 - text: "Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad."
utter_test_3_5_152_1:
 - text: "What, wait, you mean like this?"
utter_test_3_5_152_2:
 - text: "Yeah, yeah. You can do it to."
utter_test_3_5_152_3:

utter_test_3_5_152_4:

utter_test_3_4_153_0:

utter_test_3_4_153_1:
 - text: "Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?"
utter_test_3_4_153_2:
 - text: "Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right."
utter_test_3_4_153_3:
 - text: "But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear."
utter_test_3_4_153_4:
 - text: "It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!"
utter_test_3_4_153_5:
 - text: "If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug."
utter_test_3_4_153_6:
 - text: "Right."
utter_test_3_4_153_7:
 - text: "In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was."
utter_test_3_4_153_8:
 - text: "Amazingly, that makes sense."
utter_test_3_4_153_9:
 - text: "You think?"
utter_test_3_4_153_10:
 - text: "Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"
utter_test_3_4_153_11:
 - text: "Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way."
utter_test_8_11_154_0:
 - text: "Hey!  Hey!"
utter_test_8_11_154_1:
 - text: "Hi!"
utter_test_8_11_154_2:

utter_test_8_11_154_4:
 - text: "Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now."
utter_test_8_11_154_5:
 - text: "Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?"
utter_test_8_11_154_6:
 - text: "Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!"
utter_test_8_11_154_7:
 - text: "I’m missin’ picture time?!"
utter_test_8_11_154_8:
 - text: "Y’know she has a face Ross!"
utter_test_8_11_154_9:
 - text: "Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us."
utter_test_8_11_154_10:
 - text: "Wow!"
utter_test_8_11_154_11:
 - text: "That is a good one!"
utter_test_8_11_154_12:
 - text: "Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow."
utter_test_8_11_154_13:
 - text: "Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it."
utter_test_8_11_154_14:
 - text: "Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?"
utter_test_8_11_154_15:
 - text: "Together? Like-like to people?"
utter_test_8_11_154_16:

utter_test_8_11_154_19:
 - text: "Uh sure, sure."
utter_test_8_11_154_20:
 - text: "Bye guys."
utter_test_3_15_155_0:
 - text: "I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore."
utter_test_3_15_155_1:
 - text: "You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?"
utter_test_3_15_155_2:
 - text: "Is this about Mark?"
utter_test_3_15_155_3:
 - text: "Oh my God."
utter_test_3_15_155_4:
 - text: "Okay, it’s not, it’s not."
utter_test_3_15_155_5:
 - text: "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break."
utter_test_3_15_155_6:
 - text: "Fine, you’re right."
utter_test_3_15_155_7:
 - text: "Let’s ah, let’s take a break,  let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.."
utter_test_3_15_155_8:
 - text: "No. A break from us."
utter_test_8_11_156_0:
 - text: "Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock."
utter_test_8_11_156_1:
 - text: "Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work."
utter_test_8_11_156_2:
 - text: "Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then."
utter_test_8_11_156_3:
 - text: "Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either."
utter_test_8_11_156_4:
 - text: "Oh? Why not?"
utter_test_8_11_156_5:
 - text: "It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament."
utter_test_8_11_156_6:
 - text: "What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?"
utter_test_8_11_156_7:
 - text: "Well now-now you’re just talking crazy."
utter_test_8_11_156_8:
 - text: "So why can’t the three of us go out together?"
utter_test_8_11_156_9:
 - text: "Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me."
utter_test_8_11_156_10:
 - text: "Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there."
utter_test_8_11_156_11:
 - text: "And the way she looked at me, pure lust."
utter_test_8_11_156_12:
 - text: "Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?"
utter_test_8_11_156_13:
 - text: "Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this."
utter_test_8_11_156_14:
 - text: "Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club."
utter_test_8_11_156_15:
 - text: "Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch."
utter_test_9_17_157_0:
 - text: "Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya."
utter_test_9_17_157_1:
 - text: "It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep."
utter_test_9_17_157_2:
 - text: ": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!"
utter_test_9_17_157_3:
 - text: "It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
utter_test_9_17_157_4:
 - text: "What are you doing?"
utter_test_9_17_157_5:
 - text: "Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy."
utter_test_9_17_157_6:
 - text: "Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom."
utter_test_9_17_157_7:
 - text: "There you go sweetie...     This isn't over."
utter_test_3_20_158_0:
 - text: "Did he call?"
utter_test_3_20_158_1:
 - text: "No. Sorry."
utter_test_3_20_158_2:
 - text: "Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?"
utter_test_3_20_158_3:
 - text: "Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women."
utter_test_3_20_158_4:
 - text: "Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?"
utter_test_3_20_158_5:
 - text: "Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss."
utter_test_3_20_158_6:
 - text: "Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?"
utter_test_6_1_159_0:
 - text: "The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?"
utter_test_6_1_159_1:
 - text: "Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that."
utter_test_6_2_160_0:
 - text: "And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?"
utter_test_6_2_160_1:
 - text: "I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!"
utter_test_6_2_160_2:
 - text: "Is that too much to ask after six years?!"
utter_test_6_2_160_3:
 - text: "I mean what?"
utter_test_6_2_160_4:
 - text: "Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!"
utter_test_6_2_160_5:
 - text: "I mean do we not have as much fun?!"
utter_test_6_2_160_6:
 - text: "Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!"
utter_test_6_2_160_7:
 - text: "I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!"
utter_test_6_2_160_8:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_test_6_2_160_9:
 - text: "I did not cry my eyes out!!"
utter_test_6_2_160_10:
 - text: "Come on!"
utter_test_6_2_160_11:
 - text: "It’s like the end of an era!"
utter_test_6_2_160_12:
 - text: "No more J-man and Channie’s!"
utter_test_6_2_160_13:
 - text: "Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
utter_test_3_16_161_0:
 - text: "Do I know why we’re rushing?"
utter_test_3_16_161_1:
 - text: "Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?"
utter_test_3_16_161_2:
 - text: "Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me."
utter_test_3_16_161_3:
 - text: "Oh, I found it!"
utter_test_3_16_161_4:
 - text: "That’s so great for you guys!"
utter_test_3_16_161_5:
 - text: "Good luck, with your girlfriend."
utter_test_3_16_161_6:
 - text: "Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!"
utter_test_3_16_161_7:
 - text: "Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
utter_test_3_16_161_8:
 - text: "Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
utter_test_3_16_161_9:
 - text: "So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?"
utter_test_3_16_161_10:
 - text: "Yes, you can, very much."
utter_test_3_16_161_11:
 - text: "Ahhhh!!"
utter_test_9_23_162_0:
 - text: "Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!"
utter_test_9_23_162_1:
 - text: "Do"
utter_test_9_23_162_2:
 - text: "Ah,"
utter_test_9_23_162_3:
 - text: "Do"
utter_test_9_23_162_4:
 - text: "Ah,"
utter_test_9_23_162_5:
 - text: "DO YOU?"
utter_test_8_18_163_0:
 - text: "Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech."
utter_test_8_18_163_1:
 - text: "Oh, come on."
utter_test_8_18_163_2:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_test_8_18_163_3:
 - text: "All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!"
utter_test_8_18_163_4:
 - text: "And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin."
utter_test_8_18_163_5:
 - text: "And what you said about Nana."
utter_test_8_18_163_6:
 - text: "Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there."
utter_test_8_18_163_7:
 - text: "And you know what?"
utter_test_8_18_163_8:
 - text: "I think she was."
utter_test_8_18_163_9:
 - text: "Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?"
utter_test_6_12_164_0:
 - text: "You forget how many great songs Heart had."
utter_test_6_12_164_1:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_test_6_12_164_2:
 - text: "You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard."
utter_test_6_12_164_3:
 - text: "So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
utter_test_6_12_164_4:
 - text: "Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it."
utter_test_6_12_164_5:
 - text: "What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey."
utter_test_6_12_164_6:
 - text: "And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions."
utter_test_6_12_164_7:
 - text: "You are not allowed to laugh at my joke."
utter_test_6_12_164_8:
 - text: "Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars."
utter_test_4_12_165_0:
 - text: "I can’t find garbage bags!"
utter_test_4_12_165_1:
 - text: "Oh, I think I saw some in here."
utter_test_4_12_165_2:
 - text: "What is it?!"
utter_test_4_12_165_3:
 - text: "I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die."
utter_test_4_12_165_4:
 - text: "I can’t believe we’re living here!"
utter_test_9_1_166_0:
 - text: "You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing?"
utter_test_9_1_166_1:
 - text: "No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out."
utter_test_9_1_166_2:
 - text: "Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!"
utter_test_9_1_166_3:
 - text: "I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it."
utter_test_9_1_166_4:
 - text: "Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out."
utter_test_9_1_166_5:

utter_test_1_4_188_6:

utter_test_4_23_189_6:

utter_test_4_23_189_7:

utter_test_6_21_192_10:
 - text: "And how none of it matters when the people really love each other."
utter_test_6_21_192_11:

utter_test_8_12_193_0:

utter_test_8_12_193_1:

utter_test_8_12_193_2:

utter_test_6_7_195_0:
 - text: "Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?"
utter_test_6_7_195_1:
 - text: "But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment."
utter_test_6_7_195_2:
 - text: "So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
utter_test_6_7_195_3:

utter_test_6_7_195_4:

utter_test_6_7_195_5:
 - text: "Of course not."
utter_test_6_7_195_6:

utter_test_6_7_195_7:
 - text: "I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that."
utter_test_6_7_195_8:

utter_test_5_4_196_0:

utter_test_5_4_196_2:

utter_test_5_4_196_3:
 - text: "Well, I don't know what else to do."
utter_test_5_4_196_4:
 - text: "I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!"
utter_test_5_4_196_5:
 - text: "So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!"
utter_test_5_4_196_6:
 - text: "'Cause I-I got nothing!"
utter_test_5_4_196_7:
 - text: "All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do."
utter_test_5_4_196_8:
 - text: "Okay then."
utter_test_5_4_196_9:

utter_test_5_4_196_10:

utter_test_5_4_196_15:
 - text: "This is broken!"
utter_test_5_4_196_16:
 - text: "It-it is broken!"
utter_test_5_4_196_17:
 - text: "All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me."
utter_test_6_14_197_0:
 - text: "Excuse me."
utter_test_6_14_197_1:

utter_test_6_14_197_2:

utter_test_6_14_197_3:

utter_test_6_14_197_4:

utter_test_1_12_198_0:

utter_test_1_12_198_1:
 - text: "Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
utter_test_1_12_198_2:
 - text: "No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
utter_test_1_12_198_3:
 - text: "Come on, two on one."
utter_test_1_12_198_4:
 - text: "What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
utter_test_1_12_198_5:
 - text: "What, now?"
utter_test_1_12_198_6:
 - text: "Yes, now is when you swoop!"
utter_test_1_12_198_7:
 - text: "You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!"
utter_test_1_12_198_8:
 - text: "You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
utter_test_1_12_198_9:
 - text: "My Catholic friend is right."
utter_test_1_12_198_10:
 - text: "She's distraught."
utter_test_1_12_198_11:
 - text: "You're there for her."
utter_test_1_12_198_12:
 - text: "You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!"
utter_test_4_20_199_0:
 - text: "Well, I just called Joshua"
utter_test_4_20_199_1:
 - text: "Oh, how did it go?"
utter_test_4_20_199_2:
 - text: "Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time."
utter_test_4_20_199_3:
 - text: "What did he say?"
utter_test_4_20_199_4:
 - text: "Well uh, his answering machine was"
utter_test_4_20_199_5:
 - text: "Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again."
utter_test_4_20_199_6:
 - text: "Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care."
utter_test_4_20_199_7:
 - text: "I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about."
utter_test_4_20_199_8:
 - text: "Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well."
utter_test_4_20_199_9:
 - text: "Yeah, maybe."
utter_test_4_20_199_10:
 - text: "And I-I am just trying to figure out why."
utter_test_4_20_199_11:
 - text: "Any luck?"
utter_test_4_20_199_12:
 - text: "Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?"
utter_test_4_20_199_13:
 - text: "I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again."
utter_test_4_20_199_14:
 - text: "Again. Y’know what? I think we all did."
utter_test_4_20_199_15:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_test_4_22_200_0:
 - text: "I don’t get it!"
utter_test_4_22_200_1:
 - text: "It was in my room all night!"
utter_test_4_22_200_2:
 - text: "And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it, then who did?"
utter_test_4_22_200_3:
 - text: "Shh!"
utter_test_4_22_200_4:
 - text: "We’re trying to think!"
utter_test_4_2_201_0:
 - text: "This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man."
utter_test_4_2_201_1:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_test_4_2_201_2:
 - text: "Oh yeah!"
utter_test_4_2_201_3:
 - text: "I got in there myself once."
utter_test_4_2_201_4:
 - text: "My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in."
utter_test_4_2_201_5:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_test_4_2_201_6:
 - text: "It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin."
utter_test_4_2_201_7:
 - text: "No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough."
utter_test_4_2_201_8:
 - text: "Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
utter_test_4_2_201_9:
 - text: "All right, you have yourself a deal."
utter_test_4_2_201_10:
 - text: "Okay.  See?! I told ya!"
utter_test_4_2_201_11:
 - text: "Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!"
utter_test_7_7_202_0:
 - text: "Hey! What’s up?"
utter_test_7_7_202_1:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_test_7_7_202_2:
 - text: "Hey-hey, who’s your friend?  Hey!!"
utter_test_7_7_202_3:
 - text: "Hey Joey!"
utter_test_7_7_202_4:
 - text: "Erin! Still here!"
utter_test_7_7_202_5:
 - text: "Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!"
utter_test_7_7_202_6:
 - text: "Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys."
utter_test_7_7_202_7:
 - text: "Ohh, listen. I’ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks!"
utter_test_3_25_203_0:
 - text: "I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head."
utter_test_3_25_203_1:
 - text: "Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just"
utter_test_3_25_203_2:
 - text: "Really?!"
utter_test_3_25_203_3:
 - text: "Ohh!"
utter_test_3_25_203_4:
 - text: "Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime."
utter_test_3_25_203_5:
 - text: "Really?!"
utter_test_3_25_203_6:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_test_3_25_203_7:
 - text: "I mean you definitely should do that."
utter_test_3_25_203_8:
 - text: "Y'know what, I should do it."
utter_test_3_25_203_9:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_test_3_25_203_10:
 - text: "Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool."
utter_test_3_25_203_11:
 - text: "Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!"
utter_test_3_25_203_12:
 - text: "All right."
utter_test_1_21_204_0:
 - text: "Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
utter_test_1_21_204_1:
 - text: "This woman's living my life."
utter_test_1_21_204_2:
 - text: "What?"
utter_test_1_21_204_3:
 - text: "She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!"
utter_test_1_21_204_4:
 - text: "Look at this, look."
utter_test_1_21_204_5:
 - text: "She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see."
utter_test_1_21_204_6:
 - text: "She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people."
utter_test_1_21_204_7:
 - text: "She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
utter_test_1_21_204_8:
 - text: "You're not an artist."
utter_test_1_21_204_9:
 - text: "Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't."
utter_test_1_20_205_0:
 - text: "I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty."
utter_test_1_20_205_1:
 - text: "No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is."
utter_test_1_20_205_2:
 - text: "I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
utter_test_1_20_205_3:
 - text: "Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!"
utter_test_1_20_205_4:
 - text: "I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!"
utter_test_1_20_205_5:
 - text: "Oh, that is so sick."
utter_test_1_20_205_6:
 - text: "I feel violated. And not in a good way."
utter_test_1_20_205_7:
 - text: "How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
utter_test_5_21_206_0:
 - text: "Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?"
utter_test_5_21_206_1:
 - text: "Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long."
utter_test_5_21_206_2:
 - text: "I know. My arm is killing me."
utter_test_5_21_206_3:
 - text: "No, I meant with the dropper over here."
utter_test_5_21_206_4:
 - text: "Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm"
utter_test_2_15_207_0:
 - text: "Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
utter_test_2_15_207_1:
 - text: "What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
utter_test_8_24_208_0:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_test_8_24_208_1:
 - text: "I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here."
utter_test_8_24_208_2:
 - text: "What’s the matter?"
utter_test_8_24_208_3:
 - text: "Nothing."
utter_test_8_24_208_4:
 - text: "What is it? Hey!"
utter_test_8_24_208_5:
 - text: "Really it’s nothing. I’m just"
utter_test_8_24_208_6:
 - text: "Rach come on, what?"
utter_test_8_24_208_7:
 - text: "I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone."
utter_test_8_24_208_8:
 - text: "What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?"
utter_test_8_24_208_9:
 - text: "Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs."
utter_test_8_24_208_10:
 - text: "Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
utter_test_8_24_208_11:
 - text: "I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?"
utter_test_8_24_208_12:
 - text: "Yeah, I guess so."
utter_test_8_24_208_13:
 - text: "I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?"
utter_test_8_5_209_0:
 - text: "Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!"
utter_test_8_5_209_1:
 - text: "I just found out this is Chandler’s office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!"
utter_test_6_21_210_0:
 - text: "Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
utter_test_6_21_210_1:
 - text: "We said seven!"
utter_test_6_21_210_2:
 - text: "We said six!"
utter_test_6_21_210_3:
 - text: "The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six."
utter_test_6_21_210_4:
 - text: "Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"
utter_test_6_21_210_5:
 - text: "Hi!"
utter_test_6_21_210_6:
 - text: "Oh my good God."
utter_test_6_21_210_7:
 - text: "I know what time you said."
utter_test_6_21_210_8:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_test_6_21_210_9:
 - text: "Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said."
utter_test_6_22_211_0:
 - text: "You, get out of my shop!"
utter_test_6_22_211_1:
 - text: "Well, what did he do?"
utter_test_6_22_211_2:
 - text: "He went out with my wife!"
utter_test_6_22_211_3:
 - text: "Joey!"
utter_test_6_22_211_4:
 - text: "Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did"
utter_test_6_22_211_5:
 - text: "That’s my wife!!! Get out!"
utter_test_6_22_211_6:
 - text: "Well, we should go."
utter_test_6_22_211_7:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_test_4_15_212_0:
 - text: "Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport."
utter_test_4_15_212_1:
 - text: "Oh please."
utter_test_4_15_212_2:
 - text: "Every moment is precious."
utter_test_4_15_212_3:
 - text: "Y’know?"
utter_test_4_15_212_4:
 - text: "Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving."
utter_test_4_15_212_5:
 - text: "Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then."
utter_test_4_15_212_6:
 - text: "On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane."
utter_test_4_11_213_0:
 - text: "No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him."
utter_test_4_11_213_1:
 - text: "Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
utter_test_4_11_213_2:
 - text: "Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
utter_test_4_11_213_3:
 - text: "So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed."
utter_test_4_11_213_4:
 - text: "We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."

utter_test_4_18_222_10:
 - text: "I thought I was making him filet mignon?"
utter_test_4_18_222_11:

utter_test_6_23_226_1:
 - text: "Good."
utter_test_6_23_226_2:
 - text: "Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy."
utter_test_6_23_226_3:
 - text: "Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
utter_test_6_23_226_4:
 - text: "That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open."
utter_test_6_23_226_5:
 - text: "So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?"
utter_test_6_23_226_6:
 - text: "No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone."

utter_test_3_8_227_0:

utter_test_3_8_227_1:
 - text: "Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!"
utter_test_3_8_227_2:
 - text: "You said number two."
utter_test_3_8_227_3:
 - text: "I also said number one."
utter_test_3_10_228_0:
 - text: "Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular."
utter_test_3_10_228_1:
 - text: "Can’t I just look at the handles on them?"
utter_test_3_10_228_2:
 - text: "You would think."
utter_test_3_10_228_3:
 - text: "Okay, fine."
utter_test_3_10_228_4:
 - text: "Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress?"
utter_test_3_10_228_5:
 - text: "Because, I don’t care."
utter_test_3_10_228_6:
 - text: "I don’t care."
utter_test_3_10_228_7:
 - text: "I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do."
utter_test_3_10_228_8:
 - text: "So I don’t think I should do it anymore."
utter_test_3_10_228_9:
 - text: "I’m gonna give you my weeks notice."
utter_test_3_10_228_10:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_test_3_10_228_11:
 - text: "Gunther, I quit."
utter_test_3_10_228_12:

utter_test_6_16_229_0:

utter_test_6_16_229_1:

utter_test_6_16_229_2:

utter_test_6_16_229_3:
 - text: "Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?"
utter_test_6_16_229_4:
 - text: "Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will!  Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!"
utter_test_6_16_229_5:
 - text: "Pretty cool, huh?"
utter_test_6_16_229_6:
 - text: "But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong."
utter_test_6_16_229_7:
 - text: "Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
utter_test_6_16_229_8:
 - text: "It’s uh, right through there."
utter_test_6_16_229_9:
 - text: "Okay.  God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment"
utter_test_6_16_229_10:
 - text: "Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?"
utter_test_2_1_230_0:

utter_test_2_1_230_1:

utter_test_2_1_230_2:
 - text: "I'm still on no."
utter_test_2_1_230_3:
 - text: "Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?"
utter_test_2_1_230_4:
 - text: "No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again."
utter_test_2_1_230_5:
 - text: "What's goin' on?"
utter_test_2_1_230_6:
 - text: "Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
utter_test_2_1_230_7:
 - text: "What stupid thing did you do?"
utter_test_2_1_230_8:
 - text: "Ewww!"
utter_test_3_21_231_0:

utter_test_3_21_231_4:

utter_test_3_21_231_5:

utter_test_3_21_231_6:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_test_3_21_231_7:
 - text: "I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?"
utter_test_3_21_231_8:
 - text: "If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!"
utter_test_3_21_231_9:
 - text: "Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too."
utter_test_3_21_231_10:
 - text: "Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!"
utter_test_3_21_231_11:
 - text: "That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man."
utter_test_3_21_231_12:
 - text: "Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way."
utter_test_3_21_231_13:
 - text: "Ohhh-hoo, funny story!"
utter_test_5_4_232_0:
 - text: "So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
utter_test_5_4_232_1:
 - text: "Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
utter_test_5_4_232_2:
 - text: "So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?"
utter_test_5_4_232_3:

utter_test_5_4_232_4:
 - text: "Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
utter_test_5_4_232_5:

utter_test_5_4_232_6:
 - text: "Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?"
utter_test_5_4_232_7:

utter_test_5_4_232_9:

utter_test_1_15_237_3:

utter_test_1_15_237_4:
 - text: "My God! What happened to you?"
utter_test_1_15_237_5:
 - text: "Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?"
utter_test_1_15_237_6:
 - text: "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
utter_test_1_15_237_7:
 - text: "That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!"
utter_test_1_15_237_8:
 - text: "Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really"
utter_test_1_15_237_9:
 - text: "Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
utter_test_1_15_237_10:
 - text: "Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
utter_test_1_15_237_11:
 - text: "Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
utter_test_1_8_238_0:
 - text: "I thought it was gonna be a closed casket."
utter_test_1_8_238_1:

 - text: "Here's my retainer!"
utter_test_3_14_239_0:
 - text: "Someone in there?"
utter_test_3_14_239_1:

utter_test_7_15_240_1:
 - text: "Oh yes there is!"
utter_test_7_15_240_2:

utter_test_7_15_240_7:

utter_test_7_15_240_8:

utter_test_7_15_240_9:

utter_test_1_21_258_4:

 - text: "Ok."
utter_test_1_6_269_0:

utter_test_7_5_278_5:

utter_test_7_5_278_6:

utter_test_7_5_278_7:

utter_test_7_5_278_8:

utter_test_7_5_278_10:

utter_test_7_5_278_14:
 - text: "Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid."
utter_test_7_5_278_15:

utter_test_6_4_279_6:
 - text: "Yeah that seems fair. We never use them."
utter_test_6_4_279_7:
 - text: "Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?"
utter_test_6_4_279_8:
 - text: "Well"
utter_test_6_4_279_9:
 - text: "Why don’t you phase it out?"
utter_test_6_4_279_10:
 - text: "Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America."
utter_test_6_4_279_11:
 - text: "Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!"
utter_test_6_4_279_12:
 - text: "They’re not listening too me?"
utter_test_6_4_279_13:
 - text: "Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you."
utter_test_6_4_279_14:
 - text: "Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?"
utter_test_6_4_279_15:

utter_train_8_21_0_3:

utter_train_8_21_0_4:

utter_train_8_21_0_6:

utter_train_1_4_21_9:
 - text: "Oh, and deaf."
utter_train_1_4_21_10:

utter_train_5_18_26_1:
 - text: "Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so"
utter_train_5_18_26_2:

utter_train_5_18_26_3:

utter_train_9_23_29_2:

utter_train_9_23_29_3:
 - text: "David is going to propose to Phoebe."
utter_train_9_23_29_4:

utter_train_9_23_29_6:

utter_train_9_23_29_9:
 - text: "I"
utter_train_9_23_29_10:
 - text: "They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!"
utter_train_9_23_29_11:
 - text: "She'll say No, David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone"
utter_train_9_23_29_12:
 - text: "Man, that's some"
utter_train_9_23_29_13:

utter_train_5_23_34_1:
 - text: "I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater."
utter_train_5_23_34_2:

utter_train_5_23_34_3:
 - text: "Yep! That's hilarious!"
utter_train_5_23_34_4:
 - text: "I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done."
utter_train_5_23_34_5:
 - text: "Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
utter_train_5_23_34_6:
 - text: "No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times."
utter_train_5_23_34_7:
 - text: "Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building."
utter_train_5_23_34_8:
 - text: "Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily."
utter_train_5_23_34_9:
 - text: "What?! You totally get embarrassed!"
utter_train_5_23_34_10:
 - text: "No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
utter_train_5_23_34_11:
 - text: "Is that so?"
utter_train_5_23_34_12:

utter_train_5_23_34_13:

utter_train_7_9_35_1:

utter_train_7_9_35_2:
 - text: "I rode a bike!"
utter_train_7_9_35_3:
 - text: "I never thought I’d be able to do that!"
utter_train_7_9_35_4:
 - text: "Thank you Ross."
utter_train_7_9_35_5:
 - text: "Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them."
utter_train_4_22_36_0:
 - text: "Hey, both you guys should be up there with me."
utter_train_4_22_36_1:

utter_train_8_2_38_1:

utter_train_8_2_38_2:
 - text: "Okay!"
utter_train_8_2_38_3:
 - text: "Well, I’m gonna go get these  in some water."
utter_train_8_2_38_4:
 - text: "Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?"
utter_train_8_2_38_5:
 - text: "No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby."
utter_train_8_2_38_6:
 - text: "Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming."
utter_train_8_2_38_7:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_8_2_38_8:

utter_train_3_19_39_2:
 - text: "Huh?"
utter_train_3_19_39_3:
 - text: "Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!"
utter_train_3_19_39_4:

utter_train_3_19_39_5:
 - text: "You look at me, and it’s nothin’."
utter_train_3_19_39_6:
 - text: "Nothing."
utter_train_3_19_39_7:
 - text: "Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice."
utter_train_3_19_39_8:
 - text: "I have a question about this scene."
utter_train_3_19_39_9:
 - text: "Yes?"
utter_train_3_19_39_10:
 - text: "Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor."
utter_train_3_19_39_11:
 - text: "Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking."
utter_train_3_19_39_12:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_train_3_19_39_13:
 - text: "I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that."
utter_train_3_19_39_14:
 - text: "Oh, hey, how about this one."
utter_train_3_19_39_15:
 - text: "Ah, it’s says so in the script!"
utter_train_3_19_39_16:
 - text: "Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch."
utter_train_3_19_39_17:
 - text: "It doesn’t say that in the script."
utter_train_3_19_39_18:
 - text: "It does in mine!"
utter_train_8_4_40_0:
 - text: "I can’t"
utter_train_8_4_40_1:
 - text: "Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake."
utter_train_8_4_40_2:
 - text: "Y’know who has a great video camera?"
utter_train_8_4_40_3:
 - text: "Greg and Jenny?"
utter_train_8_4_40_4:
 - text: "Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em."
utter_train_8_4_40_5:
 - text: "Let’s call ‘em."
utter_train_8_4_40_6:
 - text: "Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!"
utter_train_8_4_40_7:
 - text: "Hello?  Eighth street deli?"
utter_train_8_4_40_8:
 - text: "Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place."
utter_train_8_4_40_9:
 - text: "Uh sorry, wrong number."
utter_train_8_4_40_10:
 - text: "Here you go."
utter_train_8_4_40_11:
 - text: "Hello?   It’s the deli again!"
utter_train_8_4_40_12:
 - text: "All right! I’ll have a sandwich!"
utter_train_8_4_40_13:

utter_train_8_4_40_14:

utter_train_1_13_41_0:

utter_train_1_13_41_1:
 - text: "Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?"
utter_train_1_13_41_2:
 - text: "Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician."
utter_train_1_13_41_3:
 - text: "Sure. So how long you been..."
utter_train_1_13_41_4:
 - text: "Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?"
utter_train_1_13_41_5:
 - text: "Since then?!"
utter_train_1_13_41_6:
 - text: "No, it's only been six years."
utter_train_1_13_41_7:
 - text: "I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy."
utter_train_1_13_41_8:
 - text: "...Joe."
utter_train_1_13_41_9:
 - text: "Y'ever been in love?"
utter_train_1_13_41_10:
 - text: "...I d'know."
utter_train_1_13_41_11:
 - text: "Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes."
utter_train_1_13_41_12:
 - text: "You're one to talk."
utter_train_1_13_41_13:
 - text: "Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
utter_train_1_13_41_14:
 - text: "Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma."
utter_train_1_13_41_15:
 - text: "Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
utter_train_3_23_42_0:
 - text: "Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?"
utter_train_3_23_42_1:
 - text: "Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  That’s supposed to be a duck right? ‘Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league."
utter_train_3_19_43_0:
 - text: "Hey, Rach, how was work?"
utter_train_3_19_43_1:
 - text: "Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair."
utter_train_3_19_43_2:
 - text: "By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
utter_train_3_19_43_3:
 - text: "Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming."
utter_train_3_19_43_4:
 - text: "I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
utter_train_3_19_43_5:
 - text: "Something wrong?"
utter_train_3_19_43_6:
 - text: "No. Nothing."
utter_train_9_23_44_0:
 - text: "And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century."
utter_train_9_23_44_1:
 - text: "Yeah, that's it?"
utter_train_9_23_44_2:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_train_4_18_45_0:
 - text: "Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
utter_train_4_18_45_1:
 - text: "No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!"
utter_train_4_18_45_2:
 - text: "It’s not that bad."
utter_train_4_18_45_3:
 - text: "Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
utter_train_4_18_45_4:
 - text: "So, you’re just Bing?"
utter_train_4_19_46_0:
 - text: "Because we won our apartment back!"
utter_train_4_19_46_1:
 - text: "What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!"
utter_train_4_19_46_2:
 - text: "No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!"
utter_train_4_19_46_3:
 - text: "I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!"
utter_train_4_19_46_4:
 - text: "All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again."
utter_train_4_19_46_5:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_4_19_46_6:
 - text: "Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!"
utter_train_4_19_46_7:
 - text: "Uh-huh, not as high as… It worked! King!"
utter_train_4_19_46_8:
 - text: "Yeah baby!"
utter_train_4_19_46_9:
 - text: "But, we pick again! We pick again!"
utter_train_4_19_46_10:
 - text: "Why?!"
utter_train_4_19_46_11:
 - text: "I don’t know!"
utter_train_4_19_46_12:
 - text: "Tickets please!  That’s courtside baby!"
utter_train_4_19_46_13:
 - text: "Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!"
utter_train_4_19_46_14:
 - text: "No they didn’t!"
utter_train_2_6_47_0:
 - text: "You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?"
utter_train_2_6_47_1:
 - text: "It's gonna be worth it."
utter_train_2_6_47_2:
 - text: "It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?"
utter_train_2_6_47_3:
 - text: "Women love guys who love babies."
utter_train_2_6_47_4:
 - text: "It's that whole sensitive thing."
utter_train_2_6_47_5:
 - text: "Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there."
utter_train_2_6_47_6:
 - text: "Maybe one of them will break away."
utter_train_2_6_47_7:
 - text: "No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left."
utter_train_2_6_47_8:
 - text: "All right, gimme the baby."
utter_train_2_6_47_9:

utter_train_2_6_47_11:
 - text: "Oh, seriously you want him?"
utter_train_2_6_47_12:
 - text: "Hello."
utter_train_2_6_47_13:
 - text: "Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
utter_train_2_6_47_14:
 - text: "You wanna smell him?"
utter_train_2_6_47_15:
 - text: "Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head."
utter_train_2_6_47_16:
 - text: "What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?"
utter_train_2_6_47_17:
 - text: "Well, we are great guys."
utter_train_1_15_48_0:
 - text: "Bye."
utter_train_6_18_49_0:
 - text: "Well, not really."
utter_train_6_18_49_1:
 - text: "I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon."
utter_train_6_18_49_2:
 - text: "Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
utter_train_6_18_49_3:
 - text: "Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents."
utter_train_6_18_49_4:
 - text: "Yeah. What-what should I do?"
utter_train_6_18_49_5:
 - text: "Well Ross, it seems pretty clear."
utter_train_6_18_49_6:
 - text: "I mean what’s more important?"
utter_train_6_18_49_7:
 - text: "What people think or how you feel, huh?"
utter_train_6_18_49_8:
 - text: "Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
utter_train_6_18_49_9:
 - text: "Joey that is so sweet."
utter_train_6_18_49_10:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_6_18_49_11:
 - text: "Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?"
utter_train_6_18_49_12:
 - text: "I couldn’t do it."
utter_train_6_18_49_13:
 - text: "You couldn’t do it?!"
utter_train_6_18_49_14:
 - text: "Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight."
utter_train_6_18_49_15:
 - text: "What?! You’re going out with her again!"
utter_train_6_18_49_16:
 - text: "Going out with who?"
utter_train_6_18_49_17:
 - text: "Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
utter_train_6_18_49_18:
 - text: "Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh"
utter_train_6_18_49_19:
 - text: "No, that was Dana Caplin."
utter_train_6_18_49_20:
 - text: "Joey! You didn’t even know her!"
utter_train_6_18_49_21:
 - text: "Ah whatever!"
utter_train_6_21_50_0:
 - text: "Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!"
utter_train_6_21_50_1:
 - text: "Don’t touch him!"
utter_train_6_21_50_2:
 - text: "Okay!"
utter_train_6_21_50_3:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_6_21_50_4:
 - text: "Umm, all right Wayne, level with me."
utter_train_6_21_50_5:
 - text: "I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired."
utter_train_6_21_50_6:
 - text: "Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!"
utter_train_6_21_50_7:
 - text: "Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!"
utter_train_6_21_50_8:
 - text: "I mean, I love-I love this little guy!"
utter_train_6_21_50_9:
 - text: "Ah-ah!!"
utter_train_6_21_50_10:
 - text: "Okay, that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right?"
utter_train_6_21_50_11:
 - text: "Here you go!"
utter_train_6_21_50_12:
 - text: "Okay?"
utter_train_6_21_50_13:
 - text: "Stupid!"
utter_train_6_21_50_14:
 - text: "I can’t believe it!"
utter_train_6_21_50_15:
 - text: "God!"
utter_train_6_21_50_16:
 - text: "Hey, how you doin’?"
utter_train_3_15_51_0:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_3_15_51_1:
 - text: "Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
utter_train_3_15_51_2:
 - text: "No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
utter_train_3_15_51_3:
 - text: "I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me."
utter_train_3_15_51_4:
 - text: "For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?"
utter_train_3_15_51_5:
 - text: "You had no"
utter_train_3_15_51_6:
 - text: "Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
utter_train_3_15_51_7:
 - text: "But I told you, I didn’t have the time!"
utter_train_3_15_51_8:
 - text: "Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
utter_train_3_15_51_9:
 - text: "Wh, Ross what do you want from me?"
utter_train_3_15_51_10:
 - text: "You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
utter_train_3_21_52_0:
 - text: "I know."
utter_train_3_21_52_1:
 - text: "Ooh, I have to tell you something."
utter_train_3_21_52_2:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_3_21_52_3:
 - text: "But I can’t tell you."
utter_train_3_21_52_4:
 - text: "Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
utter_train_3_21_52_5:
 - text: "Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods."
utter_train_3_21_52_6:
 - text: "Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?"
utter_train_3_21_52_7:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_3_21_52_8:
 - text: "Does it have to do with Joey?"
utter_train_3_21_52_9:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_3_21_52_10:
 - text: "Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?"
utter_train_3_21_52_11:
 - text: "No, but let’s come back to that later!"
utter_train_6_24_53_0:
 - text: "Hi!"
utter_train_6_24_53_1:
 - text: "Richard!"
utter_train_6_24_53_2:
 - text: "Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef."
utter_train_6_24_53_3:
 - text: "Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef."
utter_train_6_24_53_4:
 - text: "Like I have nothing better to do!"
utter_train_6_24_53_5:
 - text: "So what’s up?"
utter_train_6_24_53_6:
 - text: "Well, it was great seeing you the other night."
utter_train_6_24_53_7:
 - text: "Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?"
utter_train_6_24_53_8:
 - text: "No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you."
utter_train_8_10_54_0:
 - text: "One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
utter_train_8_10_54_1:
 - text: "So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?"
utter_train_8_10_54_2:
 - text: "Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!"
utter_train_8_10_54_3:
 - text: "Joey, I am scared to death about this."
utter_train_8_10_54_4:
 - text: "But I really think I can do it, I’m just gonna need some help."
utter_train_8_10_54_5:
 - text: "And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time."
utter_train_8_10_54_6:
 - text: "You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we’re straight-up gangster rap."
utter_train_8_10_54_7:
 - text: "Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?"
utter_train_8_10_54_8:
 - text: "Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!"
utter_train_8_10_54_9:
 - text: "And you’re my big brother!"
utter_train_8_10_54_10:
 - text: "I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world."
utter_train_8_10_54_11:
 - text: "I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad."
utter_train_8_10_54_12:
 - text: "I was scared of telling you."
utter_train_8_10_54_13:
 - text: "Well I’d be scared of them, but all right."
utter_train_8_10_54_14:
 - text: "Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me."
utter_train_8_10_54_15:
 - text: "I want him to have his uncle."
utter_train_8_10_54_16:
 - text: "Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?"
utter_train_8_10_54_17:
 - text: "Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!"
utter_train_8_10_54_18:
 - text: "We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us."
utter_train_8_10_54_19:
 - text: "That’s right! By his uncle too!"
utter_train_8_10_54_20:
 - text: "And by you."
utter_train_8_10_54_21:
 - text: "Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment."
utter_train_8_10_54_22:
 - text: "Come here!"
utter_train_8_10_54_23:
 - text: "No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!"
utter_train_5_10_55_0:
 - text: "I had a really nice time tonight."
utter_train_5_10_55_1:
 - text: "So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out."
utter_train_5_10_55_2:

utter_train_6_3_67_13:
 - text: "No, I won’t."
utter_train_6_3_67_14:
 - text: "But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise."
utter_train_6_3_67_15:
 - text: "She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!"
utter_train_1_6_68_0:

utter_train_1_5_69_3:

utter_train_1_5_69_4:
 - text: "Yeah, it was really hard."
utter_train_1_5_69_5:

utter_train_4_2_70_0:
 - text: "Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!"
utter_train_4_2_70_1:
 - text: "Pretty nice?"
utter_train_4_2_70_2:
 - text: "You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
utter_train_4_2_70_3:
 - text: "We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe."
utter_train_4_2_70_4:
 - text: "Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe."
utter_train_4_2_70_5:
 - text: "You gotta take the canoe!"
utter_train_4_2_70_6:
 - text: "All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
utter_train_4_2_70_7:
 - text: "We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!"
utter_train_4_2_70_8:

utter_train_4_15_72_3:
 - text: "I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand."
utter_train_4_15_72_4:
 - text: "What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?"
utter_train_4_15_72_5:
 - text: "Are you travelling with a child?"
utter_train_4_15_72_6:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_4_15_72_7:
 - text: "All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card."
utter_train_3_21_73_0:
 - text: "Okay, but this is the last time."

utter_train_8_4_76_7:

utter_train_1_7_81_10:
 - text: "Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
utter_train_1_7_81_11:
 - text: "This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything."
utter_train_1_7_81_12:

utter_train_1_7_81_13:

utter_train_1_7_81_14:
 - text: "I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo."
utter_train_1_7_81_15:
 - text: "I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in."
utter_train_1_7_81_16:
 - text: "Looks like I was second to last."
utter_train_7_22_82_0:
 - text: "Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad."
utter_train_7_22_82_1:

utter_train_7_22_82_2:
 - text: "Chandler! He’s your father.  he should be at the wedding."
utter_train_7_22_82_3:

utter_train_7_22_82_4:
 - text: "Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!"
utter_train_7_22_82_5:
 - text: "It’s not like we run in the same circles."
utter_train_7_22_82_6:
 - text: "I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
utter_train_7_22_82_7:
 - text: "Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
utter_train_7_22_82_9:
 - text: "Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
utter_train_7_22_82_10:
 - text: "So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care."
utter_train_7_22_82_11:
 - text: "Okay, I think I need to do some shopping."

utter_train_4_20_89_8:

utter_train_7_19_99_8:

utter_train_7_19_99_9:

utter_train_7_19_99_10:

utter_train_7_19_99_11:

utter_train_3_23_100_2:

utter_train_3_23_100_5:

utter_train_3_23_100_6:
 - text: "Well that's not a third nipple."
utter_train_3_23_100_7:
 - text: "No?"
utter_train_6_23_101_0:

utter_train_8_23_106_4:

utter_train_8_23_106_5:

utter_train_1_3_107_1:

utter_train_1_3_107_2:
 - text: "Do you all promise?"
utter_train_1_3_107_4:
 - text: "Chandler? Do you promise to be good?"
utter_train_1_3_107_5:
 - text: "You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
utter_train_1_3_107_6:
 - text: "Hey, Pheebs."
utter_train_1_3_107_7:
 - text: "Dear Ms. Buffay."

utter_train_8_17_108_4:
 - text: "Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again."
utter_train_8_17_108_5:
 - text: "What problem did you tell him you had?"
utter_train_8_17_108_6:
 - text: "Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay."
utter_train_4_14_109_0:
 - text: "Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
utter_train_4_14_109_1:

utter_train_4_14_109_5:

utter_train_4_14_109_6:
 - text: "Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call."
utter_train_4_14_109_7:
 - text: "I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club."
utter_train_4_14_109_8:
 - text: "Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
utter_train_4_14_109_9:
 - text: "Come on! Look where you are!!"
utter_train_4_14_109_10:

utter_train_4_14_109_12:
 - text: "Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy."
utter_train_4_14_109_13:
 - text: "Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy."
utter_train_4_14_109_14:
 - text: "Well, if you think it will help."
utter_train_4_14_109_15:
 - text: "No!"
utter_train_4_14_109_16:
 - text: "That was a test!"
utter_train_4_14_109_17:
 - text: "In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!"
utter_train_4_14_109_18:
 - text: "And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice"
utter_train_4_14_109_19:
 - text: "You should! How is she?"
utter_train_4_14_109_20:

utter_train_4_14_109_21:
 - text: "I think somebody needs another lap dance."
utter_train_7_3_110_0:
 - text: "All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
utter_train_7_3_110_1:
 - text: "You do?"
utter_train_7_3_110_2:
 - text: "You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman."
utter_train_7_3_110_3:
 - text: "That and arrogance."
utter_train_7_3_110_4:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_7_3_110_5:
 - text: "Hey! How was sailing?"
utter_train_7_1_111_0:

utter_train_7_1_111_1:

utter_train_7_1_111_2:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_train_7_1_111_3:
 - text: "Uh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?"
utter_train_7_1_111_4:
 - text: "When? Today? Some, not a lot."
utter_train_7_1_111_5:
 - text: "Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn’t…."
utter_train_7_1_111_6:
 - text: "There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident."
utter_train_7_1_111_7:
 - text: "Don’t worry about that man, that happens."
utter_train_7_1_111_8:
 - text: "It’s happened to you?"
utter_train_7_1_111_9:
 - text: "Yeah! Once."
utter_train_7_1_111_10:
 - text: "Well, what’d you do?"
utter_train_7_1_111_11:
 - text: "I did it anyway."
utter_train_7_1_111_12:
 - text: "‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?"
utter_train_7_1_111_13:
 - text: "Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me."
utter_train_7_1_111_14:
 - text: "So you’re playing a little"
utter_train_7_1_111_15:
 - text: "Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
utter_train_7_1_111_16:
 - text: "Come on man, really how old?!"
utter_train_7_1_111_17:
 - text: "Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
utter_train_7_2_112_0:
 - text: "And they knew about it?"
utter_train_7_2_112_1:
 - text: "Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
utter_train_7_2_112_2:
 - text: "Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!"
utter_train_7_2_112_3:
 - text: "Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!"
utter_train_7_2_112_4:
 - text: "The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer."
utter_train_1_10_113_0:
 - text: "Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
utter_train_1_10_113_1:
 - text: "Do you always have to bring him here?"
utter_train_1_10_113_2:
 - text: "I didn't wanna leave him alone."
utter_train_1_10_113_3:
 - text: "Alright?"
utter_train_1_10_113_4:
 - text: "We- we had our first fight this morning."
utter_train_1_10_113_5:
 - text: "I think it has to do with my working late."
utter_train_1_10_113_6:
 - text: "I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
utter_train_1_10_113_7:
 - text: "Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
utter_train_1_10_113_8:
 - text: "Oh, that'd be great!"
utter_train_1_10_113_9:
 - text: "Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
utter_train_1_10_113_10:
 - text: "Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
utter_train_4_21_114_0:
 - text: "Check this out."
utter_train_4_21_114_1:
 - text: "It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!"
utter_train_4_21_114_2:
 - text: "It’s almost as good as being there."
utter_train_4_21_114_3:
 - text: "It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!"
utter_train_4_21_114_4:
 - text: "Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!"
utter_train_3_7_115_0:
 - text: "Uh, may I help you?"
utter_train_3_7_115_1:
 - text: "Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed."
utter_train_3_7_115_2:
 - text: "Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller."
utter_train_3_7_115_3:
 - text: "All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
utter_train_3_7_115_4:
 - text: "Nobody sees the king!"
utter_train_3_7_115_5:
 - text: "Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king."
utter_train_3_7_115_6:
 - text: "Hey! You can’t go back there!"
utter_train_3_7_115_7:
 - text: "Oh my God."
utter_train_3_10_116_0:
 - text: "So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?"
utter_train_3_10_116_1:
 - text: "I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore."
utter_train_3_10_116_2:
 - text: "Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a"

utter_train_1_12_148_12:

utter_train_1_1_152_0:

utter_train_5_24_162_0:

utter_train_1_1_164_5:

utter_train_6_19_201_6:

utter_train_6_5_202_9:

utter_train_6_5_202_12:

utter_train_6_5_202_13:
 - text: "You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out."
utter_train_6_5_202_14:

 - text: "Well, I don’t have to buy that, I’m with stupid T-shirt anymore."
utter_train_4_23_236_4:
 - text: "Well, I like it. Here you go."
utter_train_4_23_236_5:
 - text: "All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
utter_train_4_23_236_6:
 - text: "Oh, I embarrass you?"
utter_train_4_23_236_7:
 - text: "How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?"
utter_train_4_23_236_9:
 - text: "Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?"
utter_train_4_23_236_10:
 - text: "They’re all tourists."
utter_train_4_23_236_11:
 - text: "All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
utter_train_4_23_236_12:
 - text: "Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat."
utter_train_4_23_236_13:
 - text: "Good choice."
utter_train_4_23_236_14:
 - text: "Thanks."
utter_train_4_23_236_15:
 - text: "Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!"
utter_train_3_12_237_0:
 - text: "So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
utter_train_3_12_237_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_3_12_237_2:
 - text: "Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else."
utter_train_3_12_237_3:
 - text: "And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my"
utter_train_3_12_237_4:
 - text: "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
utter_train_3_12_237_5:
 - text: "You don't even know me..."
utter_train_3_12_237_6:
 - text: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you."
utter_train_3_12_237_7:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_3_12_237_8:
 - text: "The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this."
utter_train_3_12_237_9:
 - text: "I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
utter_train_3_12_237_10:
 - text: "No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?"
utter_train_3_12_237_11:
 - text: "Oh yeah."
utter_train_7_14_238_0:
 - text: "Okay, forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay, back—Stop!  Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!"
utter_train_7_14_238_1:
 - text: "Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do."
utter_train_7_14_238_2:
 - text: "Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral."
utter_train_7_14_238_3:
 - text: "You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot."
utter_train_7_14_238_4:
 - text: "Okay?"
utter_train_7_14_238_5:
 - text: "All right, here we go."
utter_train_7_14_238_6:
 - text: "Haul ass!!!"
utter_train_6_7_239_0:
 - text: "So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain."
utter_train_6_7_239_1:
 - text: "So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer..."
utter_train_6_7_239_2:
 - text: "...and live forever as a machine!"
utter_train_6_7_239_3:
 - text: "That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?"
utter_train_6_7_239_4:
 - text: "You and I, we're interfacing."
utter_train_6_7_239_5:
 - text: "Yeah, I gotta go."
utter_train_6_7_239_6:
 - text: "Ba dum bumb cheshhh!"
utter_train_9_23_240_0:
 - text: "David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
utter_train_9_23_240_1:
 - text: "Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion."
utter_train_9_23_240_2:
 - text: "See?"
utter_train_9_23_240_3:
 - text: "Yeah, that's the same as it has something to do with wind."
utter_train_9_23_240_4:
 - text: "Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
utter_train_9_23_240_5:
 - text: "Oh, I should go, too."
utter_train_9_23_240_6:
 - text: "Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
utter_train_9_22_241_0:
 - text: "Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there."
utter_train_9_22_241_1:
 - text: "And she was like Oh, don't worry!"
utter_train_9_22_241_2:
 - text: "I asked him."
utter_train_9_22_241_3:
 - text: "He's totally ok with seeing you!."
utter_train_9_22_241_4:
 - text: "So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!"
utter_train_9_22_241_5:
 - text: "Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
utter_train_9_22_241_6:
 - text: "Exactly!"
utter_train_9_22_241_7:
 - text: "And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!"
utter_train_9_22_241_8:
 - text: "I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,"
utter_train_9_22_241_9:
 - text: "Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
utter_train_9_22_241_10:
 - text: "Ok, that'll be great!"
utter_train_9_22_241_11:
 - text: "Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
utter_train_9_22_241_12:
 - text: "That's not what we're gonna do!"
utter_train_9_22_241_13:
 - text: "Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
utter_train_7_6_242_0:
 - text: "Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
utter_train_7_6_242_1:
 - text: "Hello Skidmark."
utter_train_7_6_242_2:
 - text: "It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later."
utter_train_7_6_242_3:
 - text: "It’s pretty clear."
utter_train_7_6_242_4:
 - text: "Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
utter_train_7_6_242_5:
 - text: "That’s why you broke up with me?"
utter_train_7_6_242_6:
 - text: "You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!"
utter_train_1_24_243_0:
 - text: "Ni-chou chi-ma!"
utter_train_1_24_243_1:
 - text: "Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
utter_train_2_4_244_0:
 - text: "Hi everyone."
utter_train_2_4_244_1:
 - text: "I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
utter_train_2_4_244_3:
 - text: "Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
utter_train_2_4_244_4:
 - text: "What did, what did he say?"
utter_train_2_4_244_5:
 - text: "Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know."
utter_train_2_4_244_6:
 - text: "So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so."
utter_train_7_18_245_0:
 - text: "Oh, great!"
utter_train_7_18_245_1:
 - text: "We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck."
utter_train_7_18_245_2:
 - text: "Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly."
utter_train_7_18_245_3:
 - text: "All I could think of was y’know, Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
utter_train_7_18_245_4:
 - text: "And did he?"
utter_train_7_18_245_5:
 - text: "I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself."
utter_train_7_18_245_6:
 - text: "Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
utter_train_7_18_245_7:
 - text: "I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six."
utter_train_7_18_245_8:
 - text: "Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler."
utter_train_7_18_245_9:
 - text: "Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again, am I?"
utter_train_7_18_245_10:
 - text: "You sound like a guy."
utter_train_7_18_245_11:
 - text: "No, a guy would be saying, I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
utter_train_7_18_245_12:
 - text: "Oh my God!"
utter_train_7_18_245_13:
 - text: "I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!"
utter_train_7_18_245_14:
 - text: "I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up!"
utter_train_7_18_245_15:
 - text: "I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again."
utter_train_7_18_245_16:
 - text: "You’ll have a last kiss."
utter_train_8_8_246_0:
 - text: "Thank you so much for coming back over."
utter_train_8_8_246_1:
 - text: "Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable."
utter_train_8_8_246_2:
 - text: "I know Mona, just hear me out."
utter_train_8_8_246_3:
 - text: "First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own."
utter_train_8_8_246_4:
 - text: "You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that."
utter_train_8_8_246_5:
 - text: "Focus."
utter_train_8_8_246_6:
 - text: "Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are"
utter_train_8_9_247_0:
 - text: "All right where’s that turkey!"
utter_train_8_9_247_1:
 - text: "Joey! Those are my maternity pants!"
utter_train_8_9_247_2:
 - text: "Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!"
utter_train_8_12_248_0:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_8_12_248_1:
 - text: "No!"
utter_train_8_12_248_3:
 - text: "Oh, would you look at that Monica?"
utter_train_8_12_248_4:
 - text: "I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad."
utter_train_8_12_248_5:
 - text: "Okay, I’m next.  Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!"
utter_train_8_12_248_6:
 - text: "Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning."
utter_train_8_12_248_7:
 - text: "Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!"
utter_train_8_9_249_0:
 - text: "Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?"
utter_train_8_9_249_1:
 - text: "Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table."
utter_train_8_9_249_2:
 - text: "Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work."
utter_train_8_9_249_3:
 - text: "But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!"
utter_train_8_9_249_4:
 - text: "I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!"
utter_train_8_9_249_5:
 - text: "Or Friday with no two pizzas!"
utter_train_8_9_249_6:
 - text: "All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over."
utter_train_8_9_249_7:
 - text: "No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!"
utter_train_8_9_249_8:
 - text: "All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
utter_train_8_9_249_9:
 - text: "That’s right!"
utter_train_8_9_249_10:
 - text: "‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani!"
utter_train_8_9_249_11:
 - text: "And this is what we do!"
utter_train_8_9_249_13:
 - text: "We can eat!"
utter_train_1_15_250_0:
 - text: "Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
utter_train_1_15_250_1:
 - text: "Look at this!"
utter_train_1_15_250_2:
 - text: "Oh! You have a window!"
utter_train_1_15_250_3:
 - text: "Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of..."
utter_train_1_15_250_4:
 - text: "Oh look! That guy's peeing!"
utter_train_1_15_250_5:
 - text: "Hi."
utter_train_1_15_250_6:
 - text: "Hi."
utter_train_3_21_251_0:
 - text: "Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?"
utter_train_3_21_251_1:
 - text: "Okay. Let’s use this brush."
utter_train_3_21_251_2:
 - text: "Okay. This stuff?"
utter_train_3_21_251_3:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_train_3_21_251_4:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_3_21_251_5:
 - text: "Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it."
utter_train_3_21_251_6:
 - text: "Okay-Dokey"
utter_train_1_21_252_0:
 - text: "Where exactly is your zoo?"
utter_train_1_21_252_1:
 - text: "Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience."
utter_train_1_21_252_2:
 - text: "Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
utter_train_1_21_252_3:
 - text: "Yes."
utter_train_1_21_252_4:
 - text: "Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
utter_train_1_21_252_5:
 - text: "No-no, he's, he's very docile."
utter_train_1_21_252_6:
 - text: "Even if he were... cornered?"
utter_train_1_21_252_7:
 - text: "Well I, I don't know. Why?"
utter_train_1_21_252_8:
 - text: "Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
utter_train_1_21_252_9:
 - text: "He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
utter_train_1_21_252_10:
 - text: "How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
utter_train_1_21_252_13:
 - text: "Otherwise it's just cruel."
utter_train_1_21_252_14:
 - text: "He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego."
utter_train_1_21_252_15:
 - text: "We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
utter_train_1_21_252_16:
 - text: "...He's in."
utter_train_1_21_252_17:
 - text: "He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
utter_train_1_21_252_18:
 - text: "You're making a big mistake here."
utter_train_1_21_252_19:
 - text: "I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains."
utter_train_9_21_253_0:
 - text: "My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there."
utter_train_9_21_253_1:
 - text: "Really helped speed the process along!"
utter_train_9_21_253_2:
 - text: "Janice!"
utter_train_9_21_253_3:
 - text: "You're not... gone?"
utter_train_9_21_253_4:
 - text: "Sid is still in his room."
utter_train_9_21_253_5:
 - text: "I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him."
utter_train_9_21_253_6:
 - text: "So did you do it?"
utter_train_9_21_253_7:
 - text: "Did you make your deposit?"
utter_train_9_21_253_8:
 - text: "Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!"
utter_train_9_21_253_9:
 - text: "That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?"
utter_train_9_21_253_10:
 - text: "I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok."
utter_train_9_21_253_11:
 - text: "Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is."
utter_train_9_17_254_0:
 - text: "Phoebe, where's your purse?"
utter_train_9_17_254_1:
 - text: "No, no! Give it to me!"
utter_train_9_17_254_2:
 - text: "You can't have it."
utter_train_9_17_254_3:
 - text: "Give it to me!"
utter_train_9_17_254_4:
 - text: "No"
utter_train_9_17_254_5:
 - text: "I'll go in there."
utter_train_9_17_254_6:
 - text: "Oh yeah."
utter_train_9_17_254_7:
 - text: "Phoebe come here"
utter_train_9_17_254_8:
 - text: "Haha!"
utter_train_9_17_254_9:
 - text: "Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!"
utter_train_1_22_255_0:
 - text: "What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial."
utter_train_1_22_255_1:
 - text: "I just had sex."
utter_train_1_22_255_2:
 - text: "Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
utter_train_1_22_255_3:
 - text: "Well, you never told me how old you were."
utter_train_1_22_255_4:
 - text: "Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
utter_train_1_22_255_5:
 - text: "I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'..."
utter_train_1_22_255_6:
 - text: "Don't say it."
utter_train_1_22_255_7:
 - text: "...in love with you."
utter_train_1_22_255_8:
 - text: "Really?"
utter_train_1_22_255_9:
 - text: "Sorry."
utter_train_1_22_255_10:
 - text: "Well,fall out of it."
utter_train_1_22_255_11:
 - text: "You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night."
utter_train_1_22_255_12:
 - text: "Oh god, oh god."
utter_train_1_22_255_13:
 - text: "I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad."
utter_train_1_22_255_14:
 - text: "I'm Joan Collins."
utter_train_1_22_255_15:
 - text: "Who?"
utter_train_8_22_256_0:
 - text: "That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!"
utter_train_8_22_256_1:
 - text: "Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here?"
utter_train_8_22_256_2:
 - text: "You. Like you haven’t done enough."
utter_train_8_22_256_3:
 - text: "Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do."
utter_train_8_22_256_4:
 - text: "I mean I wish I were a seahorse."
utter_train_8_22_256_5:
 - text: "Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies."
utter_train_8_22_256_6:
 - text: "And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea."
utter_train_8_22_256_7:
 - text: "God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!"
utter_train_8_22_256_8:
 - text: "Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end"
utter_train_8_22_256_9:
 - text: "Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story."
utter_train_8_22_256_10:
 - text: "Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea?"
utter_train_8_22_256_11:
 - text: "Oh God, get out!"
utter_train_8_22_256_12:
 - text: "Get out!!"
utter_train_8_22_256_13:
 - text: "Get out!!"
utter_train_8_22_256_14:
 - text: "Get out!"
utter_train_8_22_256_15:
 - text: "Let’s."
utter_train_8_12_257_0:
 - text: "All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay."
utter_train_8_12_257_1:
 - text: "Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now?"
utter_train_8_12_257_2:
 - text: "I can’t watch!"
utter_train_8_12_257_3:
 - text: "Oh."
utter_train_8_12_257_4:
 - text: "Seriously, how can you watch this?"
utter_train_8_12_257_5:
 - text: "Aren’t you scared?"
utter_train_8_12_257_6:
 - text: "Terrified."
utter_train_5_3_258_0:
 - text: "Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!"
utter_train_5_3_258_1:
 - text: "Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
utter_train_5_3_258_2:
 - text: "Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?"
utter_train_5_3_258_3:
 - text: "Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine."
utter_train_5_3_258_4:
 - text: "I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
utter_train_5_3_258_5:
 - text: "Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I"
utter_train_5_3_258_6:
 - text: "Fine! Maybe I will too!"
utter_train_5_9_259_0:
 - text: "Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away."
utter_train_5_9_259_1:
 - text: "You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!"
utter_train_5_9_259_2:
 - text: "MY SANDWICH?!!!"
utter_train_5_9_259_3:
 - text: "MY SANDWICH!!!!!!"
utter_train_3_25_260_0:
 - text: "What’s the matter, Pheebs?"
utter_train_3_25_260_1:
 - text: "She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!"
utter_train_3_25_260_2:

utter_train_1_5_262_0:

utter_train_1_5_262_1:
 - text: "It's just like pulling off a Band-aid."
utter_train_1_5_262_2:
 - text: "Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
utter_train_1_5_262_3:
 - text: "Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
utter_train_1_5_262_4:

utter_train_7_18_263_4:
 - text: "I’m just saying, get his number just in case."
utter_train_7_18_263_5:
 - text: "But no: Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill."
utter_train_7_18_263_6:
 - text: "Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged."
utter_train_7_18_263_7:
 - text: "Well you should be embarrassed."
utter_train_7_18_263_8:

utter_train_6_17_264_0:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_6_17_264_1:

utter_train_6_17_264_4:

utter_train_6_17_264_5:
 - text: "What’s up?"
utter_train_6_17_264_6:
 - text: "I can’t figure out what to make Monica."
utter_train_6_17_264_7:
 - text: "Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes."
utter_train_6_17_264_8:

utter_train_6_17_264_12:
 - text: "I made it in the sixth grade."
utter_train_6_17_264_13:
 - text: "Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon."
utter_train_6_17_264_14:
 - text: "Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon."
utter_train_6_17_264_15:
 - text: "But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
utter_train_6_17_264_16:
 - text: "Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her."
utter_train_6_17_264_17:
 - text: "Why not?"
utter_train_6_17_264_18:
 - text: "Because it says Captain Ross on the side and I hate Monica on the bottom."
utter_train_7_7_265_0:
 - text: "Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!"
utter_train_7_7_265_1:
 - text: "He might still show up."
utter_train_7_7_265_2:
 - text: "Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours."
utter_train_7_7_265_3:
 - text: "Is that all?"
utter_train_7_7_265_4:

utter_train_7_1_266_0:
 - text: "Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding."
utter_train_7_3_267_0:
 - text: "Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony."
utter_train_7_1_268_0:
 - text: "Uh, tiny!"
utter_train_7_1_268_1:
 - text: "We’re not even sure why we’re having it."
utter_train_7_7_269_0:
 - text: "It’s actually going to be just family."
utter_train_7_7_269_1:
 - text: "Oh…wait…you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing"
utter_train_5_16_270_0:

utter_train_5_15_271_9:
 - text: "You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?"
utter_train_5_15_271_10:
 - text: "Nah."
utter_train_6_1_272_0:
 - text: "How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—, a rapist or a killer or something!"
utter_train_6_1_272_1:
 - text: "Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!"
utter_train_6_1_272_2:
 - text: "Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!"
utter_train_6_1_272_3:

utter_train_6_1_272_4:

utter_train_6_1_272_8:

utter_train_6_23_273_0:
 - text: "Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?"
utter_train_6_23_273_1:
 - text: "I can’t figure this out!"
utter_train_6_23_273_2:
 - text: "It’s so hard!"
utter_train_6_23_273_3:
 - text: "Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah!"
utter_train_6_23_273_4:
 - text: "Paper cut!"
utter_train_6_23_273_5:
 - text: "Now, have you told anyone else?"
utter_train_6_23_273_6:
 - text: "No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out."
utter_train_6_23_273_7:
 - text: "You told me."
utter_train_6_23_273_8:
 - text: "Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
utter_train_6_23_273_9:
 - text: "Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet."

utter_train_6_23_273_16:
 - text: "Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place."
utter_train_6_23_273_17:
 - text: "How rude."
utter_train_6_23_273_18:
 - text: "Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite?"
utter_train_4_22_274_0:
 - text: "The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!"
utter_train_4_22_274_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_4_22_274_2:

utter_train_4_22_274_9:
 - text: "I go to bed last night, everything’s cool!"
utter_train_4_22_274_10:
 - text: "I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!"
utter_train_4_22_274_11:
 - text: "You slept with the stripper?"
utter_train_4_22_274_12:
 - text: "Of course!!"
utter_train_5_11_275_0:
 - text: "What difference does that make?!"
utter_train_5_11_275_1:
 - text: "Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
utter_train_5_11_275_2:
 - text: "Joey, do you have a minute?"
utter_train_5_11_275_3:
 - text: "Dude, what am I gonna"
utter_train_5_11_275_4:

utter_train_5_11_275_8:

utter_train_5_11_275_10:
 - text: "Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
utter_train_5_11_275_11:
 - text: "Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!"
utter_train_5_11_275_12:
 - text: "I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!"
utter_train_5_11_275_13:
 - text: "What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?"
utter_train_5_11_275_14:
 - text: "And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!"
utter_train_5_11_275_15:
 - text: "I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone"
utter_train_5_11_275_16:
 - text: "I'm not listening to you!"
utter_train_7_11_276_0:
 - text: "Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!"
utter_train_7_11_276_2:

 - text: "I’ll take those to go.  For the kids."
utter_train_8_19_277_2:
 - text: "Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?"
utter_train_8_19_277_3:
 - text: "It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said."
utter_train_8_19_277_4:
 - text: "But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today."
utter_train_8_19_277_5:
 - text: "Understood. So, what’d you say back then?"
utter_train_8_19_277_6:

utter_train_7_10_278_0:

utter_train_7_10_278_3:
 - text: "Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation."
utter_train_7_10_278_4:
 - text: "All right, okay, well, apparently not!"
utter_train_7_10_278_5:

utter_train_7_10_278_6:
 - text: "Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four..."
utter_train_7_10_278_7:

utter_train_7_10_278_8:

utter_train_4_4_279_0:
 - text: "Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
utter_train_4_4_279_1:
 - text: "Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true."
utter_train_4_4_279_2:
 - text: "I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson."
utter_train_4_4_279_3:
 - text: "Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it."
utter_train_4_4_279_4:
 - text: "That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed."
utter_train_4_4_279_5:
 - text: "All right that’s it, school is in session!"
utter_train_4_4_279_6:
 - text: "My God! Is this a gym card?"
utter_train_4_4_279_7:
 - text: "Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times."
utter_train_4_4_279_8:
 - text: "So why don’t you quit?"
utter_train_4_4_279_9:
 - text: "You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I"
utter_train_4_4_279_10:
 - text: "Who is Maria?"
utter_train_4_4_279_11:
 - text: "Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat."
utter_train_4_4_279_12:
 - text: "You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?"
utter_train_4_4_279_13:
 - text: "No!"
utter_train_4_4_279_14:
 - text: "So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?"
utter_train_4_4_279_15:
 - text: "Oh no, you’ll have to come."
utter_train_5_12_280_0:
 - text: "Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that."
utter_train_5_12_280_1:
 - text: "Exactly! Because it's in the past!"
utter_train_5_12_280_2:
 - text: "Anybody gonna eat that?"
utter_train_7_22_281_0:
 - text: "Pheebs!"
utter_train_7_22_281_1:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_7_22_281_2:
 - text: "Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?"
utter_train_7_22_281_3:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_train_7_22_281_4:
 - text: "Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!"
utter_train_7_22_281_5:
 - text: "I know. They were mine."
utter_train_7_22_281_6:
 - text: "Oh.  No! No wait, that’s weird!"
utter_train_7_22_281_7:
 - text: "No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on."
utter_train_7_22_281_8:
 - text: "That’s weird!"
utter_train_7_22_281_9:
 - text: "I’m wearing his briefs right now."
utter_train_7_22_281_10:
 - text: "That’s…kinda hot."
utter_train_1_22_282_0:
 - text: "I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick."
utter_train_1_22_282_1:
 - text: "Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that."
utter_train_1_22_282_2:
 - text: "And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin."
utter_train_7_22_283_0:
 - text: "Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!"
utter_train_7_22_283_1:
 - text: "There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you."
utter_train_7_22_283_2:
 - text: "Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys."
utter_train_7_22_283_3:
 - text: "I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear!"
utter_train_7_22_283_4:
 - text: "I don’t think you could ever do that."
utter_train_7_22_283_5:
 - text: "Hey! I"
utter_train_7_22_283_6:
 - text: "Okay, whatever."
utter_train_7_19_284_0:
 - text: "Lusts of the flesh."
utter_train_7_19_284_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_7_19_284_2:
 - text: "I don’t know.  A cowboy theme?"
utter_train_9_1_285_0:
 - text: "Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
utter_train_9_1_285_1:
 - text: "Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!"
utter_train_9_1_285_2:
 - text: "Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya."
utter_train_9_1_285_3:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_9_1_285_4:
 - text: "Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?"
utter_train_9_1_285_5:
 - text: "Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast?"
utter_train_9_1_285_6:
 - text: "It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen."
utter_train_9_1_285_7:
 - text: "Yowza"
utter_train_9_1_285_8:
 - text: "Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth."
utter_train_9_1_285_9:
 - text: "Dear Lord."
utter_train_9_1_285_10:
 - text: "I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?"
utter_train_9_1_285_11:
 - text: "Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…"
utter_train_9_1_285_13:
 - text: "Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?"
utter_train_9_1_285_14:
 - text: "She looks scared."
utter_train_9_1_285_15:
 - text: "Doesn’t she  look scared?"
utter_train_9_1_285_16:
 - text: "Y’know, I don’t really know her."
utter_train_1_15_286_0:
 - text: "Can you see my nipples through this shirt?"
utter_train_1_15_286_1:
 - text: "No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
utter_train_1_15_286_2:
 - text: "Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
utter_train_1_15_286_3:
 - text: "Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the a-gogo."
utter_train_1_14_287_0:
 - text: "Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
utter_train_1_14_287_1:
 - text: "Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
utter_train_1_14_287_2:
 - text: "No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me."
utter_train_1_14_287_3:
 - text: "The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
utter_train_1_14_287_4:
 - text: "Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
utter_train_1_14_287_5:
 - text: "Pathetic mess?"
utter_train_1_14_287_6:
 - text: "I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable."
utter_train_1_14_287_7:
 - text: "I'm thinkin', cha-ching!"
utter_train_1_14_287_8:
 - text: "Thanks."
utter_train_1_14_287_9:
 - text: "Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice."
utter_train_1_14_287_10:
 - text: "You're doin' this."
utter_train_1_14_287_11:
 - text: "Hi. She said yes."
utter_train_1_14_287_12:
 - text: "Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?"
utter_train_6_13_288_0:
 - text: "Happy birthday to you!"
utter_train_6_13_288_1:

utter_train_6_21_293_6:
 - text: "That’s not a bad idea."
utter_train_6_21_293_7:

utter_train_7_11_295_3:

utter_train_7_11_295_4:

utter_train_7_11_295_5:

utter_train_7_11_295_14:

utter_train_6_16_320_7:
 - text: "Really?"
utter_train_6_16_320_8:
 - text: "When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!"
utter_train_6_16_320_9:

utter_train_4_1_324_3:
 - text: "Hi there."
utter_train_4_1_324_4:
 - text: "...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either."
utter_train_4_1_324_5:
 - text: "And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head."
utter_train_4_1_324_6:
 - text: "And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either..."
utter_train_4_1_324_7:

utter_train_3_3_356_2:

utter_train_3_3_356_3:

utter_train_3_3_356_4:

utter_train_3_3_356_5:

utter_train_3_3_356_6:

utter_train_3_3_356_7:
 - text: "No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
utter_train_3_3_356_8:
 - text: "Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?"
utter_train_3_3_356_9:
 - text: "Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out."
utter_train_3_3_356_10:
 - text: "Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
utter_train_3_3_356_11:
 - text: "What is this? Fruit?"
utter_train_3_3_356_12:
 - text: "Monica's making jam."
utter_train_3_3_356_13:
 - text: "Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?"
utter_train_3_3_356_14:
 - text: "Because the kids need new shoes."
utter_train_3_3_356_15:
 - text: "I'm going into business people."
utter_train_3_3_356_16:
 - text: "I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard."
utter_train_3_3_356_17:
 - text: "I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man."
utter_train_3_3_356_18:
 - text: "What's the opposite of man?"
utter_train_3_3_356_19:
 - text: "Jam."
utter_train_3_3_356_20:
 - text: "Oh Joey don't!"
utter_train_3_3_356_21:

utter_train_3_3_356_22:

utter_train_3_17_357_1:
 - text: "Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?"
utter_train_3_17_357_2:
 - text: "Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles."
utter_train_3_17_357_3:
 - text: "What? Mine aren’t tinted."
utter_train_3_8_358_0:
 - text: "Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?"
utter_train_3_8_358_1:
 - text: "I will have one."
utter_train_3_8_358_2:
 - text: "Okay, I’m not gonna have one."
utter_train_3_8_358_3:
 - text: "No, no, it’s just my tooth."
utter_train_3_8_358_4:
 - text: "All right I’ll have one."
utter_train_3_8_358_5:
 - text: "So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one."
utter_train_3_8_358_6:
 - text: "No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him."
utter_train_3_8_358_7:
 - text: "See that is the problem with invisible dentists."
utter_train_3_8_358_8:
 - text: "Why? Why can’t you go to him?"
utter_train_3_8_358_9:
 - text: "Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
utter_train_3_8_358_10:
 - text: "That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse."
utter_train_3_8_358_11:
 - text: "Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
utter_train_3_8_358_12:
 - text: "Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’."
utter_train_3_8_358_13:
 - text: "And all these people actually died?"
utter_train_3_8_358_14:
 - text: "Yes, while I was in the chair!"
utter_train_3_8_358_15:
 - text: "That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
utter_train_3_8_358_16:
 - text: "Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist."
utter_train_3_8_358_17:
 - text: "It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence."
utter_train_3_8_358_18:
 - text: "Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead."
utter_train_4_17_359_0:
 - text: "Hello?"
utter_train_4_17_359_1:
 - text: "Ross."
utter_train_4_17_359_3:

utter_train_1_23_423_7:

utter_train_4_10_424_3:
 - text: "Not her."
utter_train_4_10_424_4:

utter_train_4_10_424_5:
 - text: "Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun."
utter_train_4_10_424_6:
 - text: "But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown."
utter_train_4_10_424_7:
 - text: "Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s"
utter_train_4_10_424_8:
 - text: "If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
utter_train_4_10_424_9:
 - text: "Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know?"
utter_train_4_10_424_10:
 - text: "She lives so close."
utter_train_4_10_424_11:
 - text: "And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny."
utter_train_4_10_424_12:
 - text: "On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist."

utter_train_4_10_424_15:

utter_train_7_23_425_3:
 - text: "Oh my God!"
utter_train_7_23_425_4:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_7_23_425_5:

utter_train_8_11_426_1:

utter_train_8_11_426_7:
 - text: "I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t!"
utter_train_6_18_427_0:
 - text: "All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!"
utter_train_6_18_427_1:

 - text: "Hey, it's Janice."
utter_train_6_2_430_0:
 - text: "Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?"
utter_train_6_2_430_1:
 - text: "Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!"
utter_train_6_2_430_2:

utter_train_6_2_430_3:

utter_train_5_2_431_4:
 - text: "Yeah?"
utter_train_5_2_431_5:
 - text: "All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!"
utter_train_5_2_431_6:

utter_train_5_2_431_11:

utter_train_5_2_431_13:
 - text: "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
utter_train_5_2_431_14:

utter_train_5_2_431_15:
 - text: "Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!"
utter_train_5_2_431_16:
 - text: "Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!"
utter_train_5_2_431_17:
 - text: "I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group."
utter_train_5_2_431_18:
 - text: "That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
utter_train_5_2_431_19:

utter_train_8_5_434_0:

utter_train_8_5_434_1:

utter_train_8_5_434_2:
 - text: "This is hard."
utter_train_8_5_434_3:
 - text: "Yeah I know."
utter_train_8_5_434_4:

utter_train_8_5_434_5:
 - text: "Just wait."
utter_train_8_5_434_6:

utter_train_8_5_434_7:
 - text: "You have no idea."
utter_train_8_5_434_8:
 - text: "Thanks sweetie."
utter_train_8_5_434_9:
 - text: "You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
utter_train_8_5_434_10:
 - text: "Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars."
utter_train_8_5_434_11:

utter_train_3_13_438_9:

utter_train_3_13_438_10:

utter_train_3_13_438_12:
 - text: "So um, who was she?"
utter_train_3_13_438_13:
 - text: "Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today."
utter_train_3_13_438_14:
 - text: "Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
utter_train_3_13_438_15:
 - text: "Well, you seem fine."
utter_train_3_5_439_0:

utter_train_1_14_440_3:
 - text: "Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
utter_train_1_14_440_4:

utter_train_1_14_440_5:

utter_train_5_7_442_4:

utter_train_3_17_443_0:
 - text: "Let’s get the show on it!"
utter_train_3_17_443_1:
 - text: "Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee."
utter_train_3_17_443_2:

utter_train_1_23_444_1:
 - text: "Your mom called me. So is this her?"
utter_train_1_23_444_2:
 - text: "No, this is a loaner."
utter_train_1_23_444_3:
 - text: "I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself."
utter_train_1_23_444_4:
 - text: "I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?"
utter_train_1_23_444_5:
 - text: "Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck."
utter_train_1_23_444_6:

utter_train_8_8_445_1:
 - text: "I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour."
utter_train_8_8_445_2:
 - text: "It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely."
utter_train_8_8_445_3:
 - text: "All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong."
utter_train_8_8_445_4:
 - text: "I just called a friend of mine."
utter_train_8_8_445_5:
 - text: "Yeah?"
utter_train_8_8_445_6:
 - text: "I think I may be able to book"
utter_train_8_8_445_7:
 - text: "Really?!"
utter_train_8_8_445_8:
 - text: "What is it sweetie?"
utter_train_8_8_445_9:
 - text: "There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married."
utter_train_8_8_445_10:
 - text: "I’m sorry daddy."
utter_train_8_8_445_11:

utter_train_8_8_445_12:
 - text: "Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please."
utter_train_8_8_445_13:

utter_train_8_8_445_14:
 - text: "How do you expect me to stay calm?!"
utter_train_8_8_445_15:
 - text: "This is unacceptable Rachel!"
utter_train_8_8_445_16:
 - text: "And I wanna know why?!!"
utter_train_8_8_445_17:
 - text: "Is it because that punk Ross won’t marry you?!"
utter_train_8_8_445_18:
 - text: "That’s it!"
utter_train_8_8_445_19:
 - text: "Is that it?"
utter_train_8_8_445_20:
 - text: "Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods."
utter_train_3_19_446_0:
 - text: "So, you’re like a zillionaire?"
utter_train_3_19_446_1:
 - text: "And you’re our age. You’re our age."
utter_train_3_19_446_2:
 - text: "Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."

utter_train_3_19_446_16:
 - text: "I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future?"
utter_train_3_19_446_17:
 - text: "Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!"
utter_train_3_19_446_18:

utter_train_3_18_447_2:

utter_train_8_17_449_4:

utter_train_8_17_449_5:

utter_train_3_23_450_1:

utter_train_3_23_450_7:
 - text: "Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing."
utter_train_3_23_450_8:
 - text: "It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes."
utter_train_3_23_450_9:
 - text: "I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t."
utter_train_3_23_450_10:
 - text: "Right?"
utter_train_3_23_450_11:
 - text: "I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."

 - text: "You didn’t break up with that fireman?"
utter_train_3_23_450_16:
 - text: "No, that was my way of telling you."
utter_train_3_23_450_17:
 - text: "Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints."
utter_train_3_23_450_18:
 - text: "He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me."
utter_train_3_23_450_19:
 - text: "Wow!"
utter_train_3_23_450_20:
 - text: "Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
utter_train_3_23_450_21:
 - text: "So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
utter_train_3_23_450_22:
 - text: "Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so’s Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?"
utter_train_3_23_450_23:
 - text: "So… It’s really just about the math."
utter_train_9_23_451_0:

utter_train_9_23_451_1:
 - text: "Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
utter_train_9_23_451_2:

utter_train_9_23_451_3:
 - text: "Monica, that was also true an"
utter_train_9_23_451_4:
 - text: "I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!"
utter_train_9_23_451_5:
 - text: "You knew this about me when you married me!"
utter_train_9_23_451_6:
 - text: "You agreed to take me in sickness and in health."
utter_train_9_23_451_7:
 - text: "Well, this is my sickness!"
utter_train_8_12_452_0:

utter_train_8_12_452_3:
 - text: "Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?"
utter_train_8_12_452_4:
 - text: "Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper."
utter_train_8_8_453_0:
 - text: "I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!"
utter_train_8_8_453_1:
 - text: "Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker"
utter_train_8_11_454_0:
 - text: "Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone."
utter_train_8_11_454_1:
 - text: "No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!"
utter_train_8_11_454_2:
 - text: "Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!"
utter_train_2_2_455_0:
 - text: "So."
utter_train_2_2_455_1:
 - text: "So."
utter_train_2_2_455_2:
 - text: "I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit."
utter_train_2_2_455_3:
 - text: "I mean, you know, we've never really talked."
utter_train_2_2_455_4:
 - text: "I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
utter_train_2_2_455_5:
 - text: "I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you."
utter_train_2_2_455_6:
 - text: "Really? Me?"
utter_train_2_2_455_7:
 - text: "Oh my god, are you kidding?"
utter_train_2_2_455_8:
 - text: "Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't."
utter_train_2_2_455_9:
 - text: "Well, you're not totally paranoid."
utter_train_2_2_455_10:
 - text: "Oy."
utter_train_2_2_455_11:
 - text: "Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
utter_train_2_2_455_12:
 - text: "Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?"
utter_train_2_2_455_13:

utter_train_6_23_456_5:
 - text: "They put you in jail?"
utter_train_6_23_456_6:

utter_train_6_23_456_7:
 - text: "Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
utter_train_6_23_456_8:
 - text: "I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring."
utter_train_6_23_456_9:
 - text: "Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps."
utter_train_6_23_456_10:
 - text: "Maybe it was the guy."
utter_train_6_23_456_11:
 - text: "It was the ring!"
utter_train_1_20_457_0:
 - text: "No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
utter_train_1_20_457_1:
 - text: "Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her."
utter_train_1_20_457_2:
 - text: "No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."

utter_train_1_20_457_8:
 - text: "You would've liked it."
utter_train_1_20_457_9:

utter_train_1_20_457_10:

utter_train_1_20_457_11:

utter_train_1_20_457_12:

utter_train_1_22_458_0:
 - text: "Oh my God! What does"
utter_train_5_22_459_0:

utter_train_5_22_459_7:

utter_train_5_22_459_8:

utter_train_5_22_459_9:

utter_train_5_22_459_11:
 - text: "A small puff of air, now come on!"
utter_train_6_1_460_0:
 - text: "Sure, now I’m scared."
utter_train_6_1_460_1:

utter_train_6_1_460_2:

utter_train_3_5_462_6:
 - text: "You’re building a post office?"
utter_train_3_5_462_7:

utter_train_7_11_463_4:
 - text: "Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?"
utter_train_7_11_463_5:
 - text: "Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!"
utter_train_7_11_463_6:
 - text: "It was cheesecake."
utter_train_7_11_463_7:

utter_train_7_11_463_9:
 - text: "My whole mouth just filled with saliva!"
utter_train_7_11_463_10:
 - text: "Y’know what? Forget it!"
utter_train_7_11_463_11:
 - text: "Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted."
utter_train_7_11_463_12:
 - text: "Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?"
utter_train_7_11_463_13:

utter_train_7_14_464_17:
 - text: "No, because you’re not a grandmother!"
utter_train_7_14_464_18:
 - text: "No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things."
utter_train_7_14_464_19:
 - text: "That’s why it’s so funny."
utter_train_7_14_464_20:

utter_train_1_1_467_2:
 - text: "I'm gonna go get one of those  job things."
utter_train_8_20_468_0:
 - text: "Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?"
utter_train_8_20_468_1:

utter_train_9_23_475_8:
 - text: "Why not?"
utter_train_9_23_475_9:
 - text: "Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
utter_train_9_23_475_10:

utter_train_3_24_477_6:
 - text: "Ohh, that’s too bad!"
utter_train_3_24_477_7:

utter_train_3_24_477_18:
 - text: "Fight’s over!"
utter_train_6_24_478_0:

utter_train_6_24_478_7:
 - text: "Yeah, Big Brother."
utter_train_6_24_478_8:
 - text: "Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet."
utter_train_6_24_478_9:
 - text: "Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
utter_train_6_24_478_10:

 - text: "Can you believe that?!"
utter_train_6_18_479_6:

utter_train_9_20_481_1:

utter_train_9_20_481_2:

utter_train_7_12_482_7:
 - text: "Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!"
utter_train_7_12_482_8:

utter_train_1_20_483_6:
 - text: "I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
utter_train_1_20_483_7:

utter_train_6_4_486_5:
 - text: "Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed."
utter_train_6_4_486_6:
 - text: "Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year."
utter_train_6_4_486_7:
 - text: "Let me see that!"
utter_train_6_4_486_8:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_6_4_486_9:
 - text: "Oh, I can’t believe this!"
utter_train_6_4_486_10:
 - text: "This sucks!"
utter_train_6_4_486_11:
 - text: "When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know?"
utter_train_6_4_486_12:
 - text: "And it wouldn’t matter."
utter_train_6_4_486_13:
 - text: "Now I gotta be careful?"
utter_train_6_4_486_14:
 - text: "I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire."
utter_train_6_4_486_15:
 - text: "All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent."
utter_train_6_4_486_16:
 - text: "Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
utter_train_6_4_486_17:
 - text: "look both ways before you cross the street."
utter_train_5_5_487_0:
 - text: "I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!"
utter_train_5_2_488_0:
 - text: "I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
utter_train_5_2_488_1:
 - text: "I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
utter_train_5_2_488_2:
 - text: "Do you know anything about women?"
utter_train_5_2_488_3:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_5_2_488_4:
 - text: "That's all right."
utter_train_5_2_488_5:
 - text: "Okay."

utter_train_1_22_492_0:
 - text: "...love you."
utter_train_1_22_492_1:

utter_train_1_22_492_2:

utter_train_6_23_493_1:
 - text: "Still crying?"
utter_train_6_23_493_2:
 - text: "Like a"
utter_train_6_23_493_3:
 - text: "Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex."
utter_train_6_23_493_4:
 - text: "What’s the other one?"
utter_train_6_23_493_5:
 - text: "I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one."
utter_train_6_23_493_6:
 - text: "I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking."
utter_train_6_23_493_7:
 - text: "Oh that’s right."
utter_train_6_23_493_8:
 - text: "You’re the talker."
utter_train_6_23_493_9:
 - text: "Anyway uh, great idea!"
utter_train_6_23_493_10:
 - text: "Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues."
utter_train_6_23_493_11:
 - text: "Oh, we have some"
utter_train_6_23_493_12:
 - text: "No you don’t!"
utter_train_3_17_494_0:
 - text: "Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up."
utter_train_6_17_495_0:
 - text: "Yeah, what town are we near?"
utter_train_6_17_495_1:
 - text: "Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
utter_train_6_17_495_2:
 - text: "Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?"
utter_train_3_17_496_0:
 - text: "Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
utter_train_3_17_496_1:
 - text: "Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?"
utter_train_3_17_496_2:
 - text: "I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here."
utter_train_3_17_496_3:

utter_train_7_2_505_7:
 - text: "Well, umm, not much."
utter_train_7_2_505_8:
 - text: "But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know?"
utter_train_7_2_505_9:
 - text: "So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?"
utter_train_7_2_505_10:

utter_train_3_16_506_5:
 - text: "I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now."
utter_train_3_16_506_6:
 - text: "I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever."
utter_train_3_16_506_7:
 - text: "God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross."
utter_train_3_16_506_8:

utter_train_1_22_507_4:

utter_train_1_22_507_5:

utter_train_8_23_509_4:
 - text: "They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!"
utter_train_8_23_509_5:

utter_train_7_12_513_3:

utter_train_3_11_515_2:
 - text: "Well, he’s very charming."
utter_train_3_11_515_3:

utter_train_3_7_521_2:

utter_train_3_5_526_2:

utter_train_3_5_526_3:
 - text: "Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I’m allowed to sleep with you."
utter_train_3_5_526_4:
 - text: "No, no, no, it’s flattery."
utter_train_3_5_526_5:

utter_train_3_5_526_9:
 - text: "Um, yeah."
utter_train_3_5_526_10:

utter_train_3_5_526_11:

utter_train_3_5_526_12:
 - text: "Come on!"
utter_train_3_5_526_13:
 - text: "But, okay."
utter_train_3_5_526_14:
 - text: "I’m not on the list!"
utter_train_3_5_526_15:
 - text: "Um, see, but that’s not the final draft."
utter_train_3_5_526_16:
 - text: "It’s laminated!"
utter_train_3_5_526_17:
 - text: "Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local."
utter_train_3_5_526_18:
 - text: "Y'know it’s ironic..."
utter_train_3_5_526_19:
 - text: "...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there."
utter_train_3_5_526_20:

utter_train_6_15_528_2:

utter_train_6_15_528_3:
 - text: "Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!"
utter_train_6_15_528_4:
 - text: "Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?"
utter_train_6_15_528_5:
 - text: "Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!"
utter_train_6_14_529_0:
 - text: "Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!"
utter_train_6_14_529_1:
 - text: "So that’s the only reason she could be here huh?"
utter_train_6_14_529_2:
 - text: "It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a"
utter_train_6_14_529_3:
 - text: "Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
utter_train_6_14_529_4:
 - text: "I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later."
utter_train_6_14_529_5:
 - text: "Good-bye."
utter_train_6_14_529_6:
 - text: "Whoa!"
utter_train_6_14_529_7:
 - text: "Uh, that was your sister actually."
utter_train_6_14_529_8:
 - text: "She-she thinks that you’re just using me."
utter_train_6_14_529_9:
 - text: "So?"
utter_train_3_25_530_0:
 - text: "I’m sorry."
utter_train_3_25_530_1:
 - text: "What are you doing here?!"
utter_train_3_25_530_2:
 - text: "I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
utter_train_3_25_530_3:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_train_3_25_530_4:
 - text: "Umm, okay, okay, look."
utter_train_3_25_530_5:
 - text: "I took this picture from your fridge."
utter_train_3_25_530_6:
 - text: "Okay, because I know that this is my Father."
utter_train_3_25_530_7:
 - text: "Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him."
utter_train_3_25_530_8:
 - text: "Now, look I deserve to know where I came from."
utter_train_3_25_530_9:
 - text: "All right?"
utter_train_3_25_530_10:
 - text: "So if you can help me find my Father then you should!"
utter_train_3_25_530_11:
 - text: "Otherwise, you’re just mean!"
utter_train_3_25_530_12:
 - text: "So, just tell me the truth!"
utter_train_3_25_530_13:
 - text: "All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni."
utter_train_3_25_530_14:
 - text: "My Father is Chuck Magioni?"
utter_train_3_25_530_15:
 - text: "No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!"
utter_train_3_25_530_16:
 - text: "And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth."
utter_train_3_25_530_17:
 - text: "Oh."
utter_train_3_25_530_18:
 - text: "But umm, you’re right."
utter_train_3_25_530_19:
 - text: "I think that a person should know where they come from."
utter_train_3_25_530_20:
 - text: "Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay."
utter_train_3_25_530_21:
 - text: "I’m your mother."
utter_train_3_25_530_22:
 - text: "Heh?"
utter_train_3_25_530_23:
 - text: "Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and..."
utter_train_6_4_531_0:
 - text: "What’s happening to your accent?"
utter_train_6_4_531_1:
 - text: "Come again?"
utter_train_6_4_531_2:
 - text: "What’s-what’s this nonsense?"
utter_train_6_4_531_3:
 - text: "All right, I’m-I’m not English."
utter_train_6_4_531_4:
 - text: "I’m from Long Island."
utter_train_6_4_531_5:
 - text: "I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out."
utter_train_6_4_531_6:
 - text: "I’m sorry."
utter_train_6_4_531_7:
 - text: "So, if we could just get back to the lecture."
utter_train_6_4_531_8:
 - text: "Umm, were there any questions?"
utter_train_6_4_531_9:
 - text: "About paleontology."
utter_train_6_4_531_10:
 - text: "All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression."
utter_train_6_4_531_11:
 - text: "Obviously, I screwed up."
utter_train_6_4_531_12:
 - text: "But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here."
utter_train_6_4_531_13:
 - text: "So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression"
utter_train_6_4_531_14:
 - text: "Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am"
utter_train_6_4_531_15:
 - text: "Well, hello Rachel!"
utter_train_9_12_532_0:
 - text: "Where you going, Joe?"
utter_train_9_12_532_1:
 - text: "For a walk."
utter_train_9_12_532_2:
 - text: "Oh. You mind if I join you?"
utter_train_9_12_532_3:
 - text: "Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts."
utter_train_9_12_532_4:
 - text: "Your thoughts? Plural?"
utter_train_9_12_532_5:
 - text: "Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!"
utter_train_9_12_532_6:
 - text: "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
utter_train_9_12_532_7:
 - text: "Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??"
utter_train_9_12_532_8:
 - text: "You guys are killing me!"
utter_train_9_12_532_9:
 - text: "She's forbidden fruit!"
utter_train_9_12_532_10:
 - text: "It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?"
utter_train_9_12_532_11:
 - text: "Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?"
utter_train_9_12_532_12:
 - text: "Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
utter_train_9_12_532_13:
 - text: "Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of."
utter_train_9_12_532_14:
 - text: "Great novels?"
utter_train_9_12_532_15:
 - text: "Fine ... mediocre porn"
utter_train_7_9_533_0:
 - text: "Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office."
utter_train_7_9_533_1:
 - text: "Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
utter_train_7_9_533_2:
 - text: "That’s kinda sad."
utter_train_7_9_533_3:
 - text: "Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,"
utter_train_7_9_533_4:
 - text: "Got it!"
utter_train_7_9_533_5:
 - text: "Let’s roll!"
utter_train_7_9_533_6:
 - text: "Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?"
utter_train_7_9_533_7:
 - text: "Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan."
utter_train_7_9_533_8:
 - text: "Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you."
utter_train_7_9_533_9:
 - text: "Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?"
utter_train_7_19_534_0:
 - text: "Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?"
utter_train_7_19_534_1:
 - text: "Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here."
utter_train_7_19_534_2:
 - text: "Oh! No problem! I"
utter_train_7_19_534_3:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_3_24_535_0:
 - text: "You are iron."
utter_train_3_24_535_1:
 - text: "You are steel!"
utter_train_3_24_535_2:
 - text: "Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?"
utter_train_3_24_535_3:
 - text: "I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?"
utter_train_4_2_536_0:
 - text: "I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
utter_train_4_2_536_1:
 - text: "Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
utter_train_4_2_536_2:
 - text: "Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school."
utter_train_4_2_536_3:
 - text: "You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket."
utter_train_4_2_536_4:
 - text: "I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made."
utter_train_4_2_536_5:
 - text: "They had to have that specially made?!"
utter_train_4_2_536_6:
 - text: "It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes."
utter_train_4_2_536_7:
 - text: "Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
utter_train_4_2_536_8:
 - text: "Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out."
utter_train_4_2_536_9:
 - text: "And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go."
utter_train_4_2_536_10:
 - text: "I-I owe her this."
utter_train_4_2_536_11:
 - text: "I never let her eat."
utter_train_4_2_536_12:
 - text: "Oh, you go out with him."
utter_train_4_2_536_13:
 - text: "Oh, really?!"
utter_train_4_2_536_14:
 - text: "Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?"
utter_train_4_2_536_15:
 - text: "I’ll try."
utter_train_6_10_537_0:
 - text: "Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with."
utter_train_6_10_537_1:
 - text: "Yeah, yeah, okay."
utter_train_6_10_537_2:
 - text: "Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.."
utter_train_6_10_537_3:
 - text: "Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!"
utter_train_6_10_537_4:
 - text: "Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know"
utter_train_6_11_538_0:
 - text: "Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you."
utter_train_6_11_538_1:
 - text: "Yeah but"
utter_train_6_11_538_2:
 - text: "Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind."
utter_train_6_11_538_3:
 - text: "Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!"
utter_train_6_11_538_4:
 - text: "Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!"
utter_train_6_11_538_5:

utter_train_1_21_546_14:
 - text: "Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?"
utter_train_1_21_546_15:
 - text: "What? You just click when they click."
utter_train_1_21_546_16:

utter_train_9_23_548_3:

utter_train_9_23_548_4:
 - text: "The sun is out!"
utter_train_9_23_548_5:
 - text: "Hey! Remember when I had corneas?"
utter_train_9_23_548_6:
 - text: "Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
utter_train_9_23_548_7:
 - text: "Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes."
utter_train_9_23_548_10:
 - text: "Walls are pretty thin, guys!"
utter_train_6_17_549_0:

utter_train_6_17_549_1:
 - text: "We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now."
utter_train_6_17_549_2:
 - text: "Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?"
utter_train_6_17_549_3:
 - text: "Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up."
utter_train_6_17_549_4:
 - text: "Thanks.  Well but this one starts now."
utter_train_6_17_549_5:
 - text: "Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It’s a twins study."
utter_train_6_17_549_6:
 - text: "But it’s $2,000."
utter_train_6_17_549_7:
 - text: "Sorry."
utter_train_6_17_549_8:
 - text: "Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists."
utter_train_6_17_549_9:
 - text: "We already got the results back on that on, and they’re not good."
utter_train_1_18_550_0:
 - text: "Hey! How’s it goin’?"
utter_train_6_18_551_0:
 - text: "Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes."
utter_train_6_18_551_1:
 - text: "Yes it has! I made cookies!"
utter_train_6_18_551_2:
 - text: "Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips."
utter_train_6_18_551_3:
 - text: "But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven."
utter_train_6_18_551_4:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_6_18_551_5:
 - text: "Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
utter_train_6_18_551_6:
 - text: "Okay, I’ll be out in a second."
utter_train_6_18_551_7:

utter_train_6_18_551_8:
 - text: "What are you doing?"
utter_train_6_18_551_9:
 - text: "That doesn’t lock does it?"
utter_train_2_4_552_0:
 - text: "You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
utter_train_2_4_552_1:
 - text: "That saves us a conversation."
utter_train_2_4_552_2:
 - text: "Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
utter_train_2_4_552_3:
 - text: "Me too, we should get goin'."
utter_train_2_4_552_4:

utter_train_6_10_553_0:

utter_train_6_10_553_1:
 - text: "Right. No biggie. Stay loose."
utter_train_6_10_553_2:
 - text: "Why do they keep doing that?"
utter_train_6_10_553_3:
 - text: "If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms."
utter_train_6_10_553_4:
 - text: "They’ve been taping those people up there all day."
utter_train_6_10_553_5:
 - text: "Right."
utter_train_6_10_553_6:
 - text: "Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?"
utter_train_6_10_553_7:
 - text: "Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?"
utter_train_6_10_553_8:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_train_6_10_553_9:
 - text: "Hey! You’re a good dancer!"
utter_train_6_10_553_10:
 - text: "Really?"
utter_train_6_10_553_11:
 - text: "Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little."
utter_train_6_10_553_12:
 - text: "What do you mean?"
utter_train_6_10_553_13:
 - text: "Like this."
utter_train_6_10_553_14:
 - text: "That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better."
utter_train_6_10_553_15:
 - text: "Uh-huh."
utter_train_6_10_553_16:
 - text: "Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there."
utter_train_6_10_553_17:
 - text: "No-no-no-no-no we came together!"
utter_train_6_10_553_18:
 - text: "I don’t see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!"
utter_train_6_10_553_19:
 - text: "No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot."
utter_train_6_10_553_20:
 - text: "Really, y’think so? I don’t.."
utter_train_6_13_554_0:
 - text: "Why aren’t you home yet?!"
utter_train_6_13_554_1:
 - text: "Is someone there?"
utter_train_6_13_554_2:
 - text: "Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!"
utter_train_6_13_554_3:
 - text: "What are you doing here?"
utter_train_6_13_554_4:
 - text: "Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?"
utter_train_6_13_554_5:
 - text: "We got some"
utter_train_6_13_554_6:
 - text: "Oh, he brought her back to his apartment."
utter_train_6_13_554_7:
 - text: "Who?  Is that your sister?"
utter_train_6_13_554_8:
 - text: "Ugh, she"
utter_train_6_13_554_9:
 - text: "God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!"
utter_train_6_13_554_10:
 - text: "Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!"
utter_train_6_13_554_11:
 - text: "He’s taking off her coat!"
utter_train_6_13_554_12:
 - text: "Oh, this is just terrible."
utter_train_6_24_555_0:
 - text: "Ross! Wait!"
utter_train_6_24_555_1:
 - text: "Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about"
utter_train_6_24_555_2:
 - text: "You suck!!"
utter_train_6_24_555_3:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_train_6_24_555_4:
 - text: "Okay, break-up’s still on!"
utter_train_8_16_556_0:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_8_16_556_1:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_8_16_556_2:
 - text: "Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
utter_train_8_16_556_3:
 - text: "No, I don’t want to hit you."
utter_train_8_16_556_4:
 - text: "Oh what then? Kick me?"
utter_train_8_16_556_5:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_8_16_556_6:
 - text: "What do I do?"
utter_train_8_21_557_0:
 - text: "Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this."
utter_train_8_21_557_1:
 - text: "Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store."
utter_train_8_21_557_2:
 - text: "Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description."
utter_train_8_21_557_3:
 - text: "Oh."
utter_train_8_21_557_4:
 - text: "Oh uh…I actually came here to ask you out."
utter_train_8_21_557_5:
 - text: "Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend"

utter_train_4_10_558_0:
 - text: "Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!"
utter_train_4_10_558_1:
 - text: "Well, like father, like son."
utter_train_4_10_558_2:
 - text: "Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious."
utter_train_4_10_558_3:
 - text: "Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling."
utter_train_4_10_558_4:
 - text: "Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?"
utter_train_4_10_558_5:
 - text: "Ummmmmmmm, no."
utter_train_4_10_558_6:
 - text: "You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!"
utter_train_4_10_558_8:
 - text: "Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea."
utter_train_1_1_559_0:
 - text: "Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
utter_train_1_1_559_1:
 - text: "Oh, yeah. Had that dream."
utter_train_1_1_559_2:
 - text: "Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
utter_train_1_1_559_3:
 - text: "Instead of...?"
utter_train_1_1_559_4:
 - text: "That's right."
utter_train_1_1_559_5:
 - text: "Never had that dream."
utter_train_1_1_559_6:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_1_1_559_7:
 - text: "All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring."
utter_train_7_16_560_0:
 - text: "Honey! Dinner’s ready!"
utter_train_7_16_560_1:
 - text: "What’s my little chef got for me tonight?"
utter_train_7_16_560_2:
 - text: "Your favorite!"
utter_train_7_16_560_3:
 - text: "Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!"
utter_train_7_16_560_4:

utter_train_7_16_560_7:
 - text: "Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin’?"
utter_train_1_5_561_0:
 - text: "Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate."
utter_train_1_5_561_1:
 - text: "So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is."
utter_train_1_5_561_2:
 - text: "Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
utter_train_1_5_561_3:
 - text: "Oh my god."
utter_train_1_5_561_4:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_1_5_561_5:
 - text: "Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia."
utter_train_1_5_561_6:
 - text: "Come on, they're close."
utter_train_1_5_561_7:
 - text: "Close? She's got her tongue in his ear."
utter_train_1_5_561_8:
 - text: "Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
utter_train_1_5_561_9:
 - text: "Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?"
utter_train_1_5_561_10:
 - text: "Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
utter_train_1_5_561_11:
 - text: "Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
utter_train_1_5_561_12:
 - text: "All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
utter_train_1_5_561_13:
 - text: "Oh!"
utter_train_1_5_561_14:
 - text: "Ow!"
utter_train_1_5_561_15:
 - text: "I'm outta here."
utter_train_1_5_561_16:
 - text: "Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
utter_train_1_5_561_17:
 - text: "Really?"
utter_train_1_5_561_18:
 - text: "Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
utter_train_5_24_562_0:
 - text: "Hello! One marriage please!"
utter_train_5_24_562_1:
 - text: "Yep, we wanna get married!"
utter_train_5_24_562_2:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_5_24_562_3:
 - text: "Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!"
utter_train_5_24_562_4:
 - text: "What are you doing?"
utter_train_5_24_562_5:
 - text: "Oh, that's"
utter_train_5_24_562_6:
 - text: "No, only because that's the graduation song."
utter_train_5_24_562_7:
 - text: "Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!"
utter_train_5_24_562_8:
 - text: "Are you sure you wanna do this?"
utter_train_5_24_562_9:
 - text: "Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!"
utter_train_5_24_562_10:
 - text: "Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!"
utter_train_5_24_562_11:
 - text: "Wait!  Okay!"
utter_train_4_11_563_0:
 - text: "Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?"

utter_train_3_7_577_2:
 - text: "Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil."
utter_train_3_7_577_3:
 - text: "That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13."
utter_train_3_7_577_4:

utter_train_3_6_578_6:

utter_train_3_6_578_7:

utter_train_8_23_584_6:
 - text: "Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?"
utter_train_8_23_584_7:

utter_train_8_23_584_8:
 - text: "Mom no, come on! Thank you."
utter_train_8_23_584_9:
 - text: "Just hear me out!"
utter_train_3_6_585_0:
 - text: "Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus."
utter_train_3_6_585_1:
 - text: "I can’t believe this!"
utter_train_3_6_585_2:

utter_train_7_13_589_7:
 - text: "I don’t need you guys to care about me!"

utter_train_5_18_614_16:
 - text: "We could be like the Patch Sisters!"
utter_train_5_18_614_17:
 - text: "Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!"
utter_train_5_18_614_18:
 - text: "Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!"
utter_train_5_18_614_19:
 - text: "My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding."
utter_train_5_18_614_20:
 - text: "Okay then!"
utter_train_1_3_615_0:
 - text: "Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
utter_train_1_3_615_1:
 - text: "Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
utter_train_1_3_615_2:
 - text: "Nooo.."
utter_train_1_3_615_3:
 - text: "Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"
utter_train_1_3_615_4:
 - text: "It's worse than the thumb!"
utter_train_1_3_615_5:
 - text: "Hey, this is so unfair!"
utter_train_1_3_615_6:
 - text: "Oh, why is it unfair?"
utter_train_1_3_615_7:
 - text: "So I have a flaw!"
utter_train_1_3_615_8:
 - text: "Big deal!"
utter_train_1_3_615_9:
 - text: "Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?"
utter_train_1_3_615_10:
 - text: "And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?"
utter_train_1_3_615_11:
 - text: "And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?"
utter_train_1_3_615_12:
 - text: "I mean, what the hell is that thing?"
utter_train_1_3_615_13:
 - text: "...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
utter_train_1_3_615_14:
 - text: "...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?"
utter_train_1_3_615_15:
 - text: "Well, I-I could live without it."
utter_train_1_3_615_16:
 - text: "Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
utter_train_1_3_615_17:
 - text: "Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
utter_train_1_3_615_18:
 - text: "Oh,  you do, do you?"
utter_train_1_3_615_19:
 - text: "You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
utter_train_1_3_615_20:
 - text: "Indeed there isn't... I should really get back to work."
utter_train_1_3_615_21:
 - text: "Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
utter_train_1_3_615_22:

utter_train_7_11_616_0:

utter_train_7_11_616_1:

utter_train_7_11_616_2:
 - text: "Aw! Does that mean the"
utter_train_7_11_616_3:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_7_11_616_4:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_7_10_617_0:
 - text: "You're sure? You're absolutely sure?"
utter_train_7_10_617_1:
 - text: "Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
utter_train_7_10_617_2:
 - text: "Probably?"
utter_train_7_10_617_3:
 - text: "Yeah, I don't like that word."
utter_train_7_10_617_4:
 - text: "Kind of what ‘probably’ really means."
utter_train_7_10_617_5:
 - text: "Yeah, uh-huh."
utter_train_7_10_617_6:
 - text: "Yeah, oh, Your mom probably won't kill herself, y’know?"
utter_train_7_10_617_7:
 - text: "I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on Probably!"
utter_train_7_10_617_8:
 - text: "You gotta take care of yourselves!"
utter_train_7_10_617_9:
 - text: "In"
utter_train_7_10_617_10:
 - text: "Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
utter_train_6_20_618_0:
 - text: "Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride."
utter_train_6_20_618_1:
 - text: "Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?"
utter_train_8_24_619_0:
 - text: "He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?"
utter_train_8_24_619_1:
 - text: "Oh, I’m fine."
utter_train_8_24_619_2:
 - text: "Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone."
utter_train_8_24_619_3:
 - text: "Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross."
utter_train_8_24_619_4:
 - text: "Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?"
utter_train_8_24_619_5:
 - text: "Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!"
utter_train_8_24_619_6:
 - text: "I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family."
utter_train_8_24_619_7:
 - text: "Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross."
utter_train_8_24_619_8:
 - text: "Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs."
utter_train_8_5_620_0:
 - text: "And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here."
utter_train_8_23_621_0:
 - text: "Hey. Who’s that?"
utter_train_8_23_621_1:
 - text: "New people."
utter_train_8_23_621_2:
 - text: "What happened to the Disgustingtons?"
utter_train_8_23_621_3:
 - text: "They’re having their baby!"
utter_train_8_23_621_4:
 - text: "It’s not fair Ross we got here first!"
utter_train_8_23_621_5:
 - text: "Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery."
utter_train_8_23_621_6:
 - text: "Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away."
utter_train_8_23_621_7:
 - text: "Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?"
utter_train_8_11_622_0:
 - text: "Phoebe?"
utter_train_8_11_622_1:
 - text: "Yeah?"
utter_train_8_11_622_2:
 - text: "Look at that guy by the window, wow!"
utter_train_8_11_622_3:
 - text: "He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed."
utter_train_8_11_622_4:
 - text: "Oh, what is wrong with me lately?"
utter_train_8_11_622_5:
 - text: "I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here."
utter_train_8_11_622_6:
 - text: "Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
utter_train_8_11_622_7:
 - text: "Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
utter_train_8_11_622_8:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_train_8_11_622_9:
 - text: "This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy."
utter_train_8_11_622_10:
 - text: "Really?! So this has happened to you?"
utter_train_8_11_622_11:
 - text: "Oh absolutely yeah!"
utter_train_8_11_622_12:
 - text: "Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy."
utter_train_8_11_622_13:
 - text: "Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap."
utter_train_8_11_622_14:
 - text: "Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a"
utter_train_4_22_623_0:
 - text: "Ugh!"
utter_train_4_22_623_1:
 - text: "I don’t know what I’m going to do!"
utter_train_4_22_623_2:
 - text: "I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!"
utter_train_4_22_623_3:
 - text: "Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?"
utter_train_4_22_623_4:
 - text: "Hey guys!"
utter_train_4_22_623_5:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_4_22_623_6:
 - text: "Hey"
utter_train_4_22_623_7:
 - text: "I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!"
utter_train_4_22_623_8:
 - text: "And the guys from work had a blast."
utter_train_4_22_623_9:
 - text: "Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before."
utter_train_4_22_623_10:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_train_4_22_623_11:
 - text: "And-and another one had never been to a party before, so"
utter_train_4_22_623_12:
 - text: "So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!"
utter_train_4_22_623_13:
 - text: "Yeah, right!"
utter_train_4_22_623_14:
 - text: "I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those"
utter_train_4_22_623_15:
 - text: "That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
utter_train_4_22_623_16:
 - text: "So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
utter_train_4_22_623_17:
 - text: "Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
utter_train_4_22_623_18:
 - text: "So you might say, it’s a magic ring."
utter_train_4_18_624_0:
 - text: "OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!"
utter_train_7_17_625_0:
 - text: "Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her."
utter_train_7_17_625_1:
 - text: "Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
utter_train_7_17_625_2:
 - text: "Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her"
utter_train_7_17_625_3:
 - text: "Uh-huh. Uh-huh."
utter_train_7_17_625_4:
 - text: "That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her"
utter_train_7_17_625_5:
 - text: "Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction"
utter_train_7_17_625_6:
 - text: "Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
utter_train_7_17_625_7:
 - text: "Yeah well we should order some food then."
utter_train_7_17_625_8:
 - text: "No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll"
utter_train_7_17_625_9:
 - text: "That sounds fair."
utter_train_7_17_625_10:
 - text: "Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street"
utter_train_7_17_625_11:
 - text: "Ah yeah—wait a second now!"
utter_train_7_17_625_12:
 - text: "Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date."
utter_train_7_17_625_13:
 - text: "I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that."
utter_train_7_17_625_14:
 - text: "Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates."
utter_train_7_17_625_15:
 - text: "All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates."
utter_train_7_17_625_16:
 - text: "So let’s decide on the spending limit"
utter_train_7_17_625_17:
 - text: "Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars?"
utter_train_7_17_625_18:
 - text: "I was thinking more like a hundred."
utter_train_7_17_625_19:
 - text: "Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?"
utter_train_3_6_626_0:
 - text: "Hi, again."
utter_train_3_6_626_1:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_3_6_626_2:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_3_6_626_3:
 - text: "Thank you soo, much."
utter_train_3_6_626_4:
 - text: "Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
utter_train_3_6_626_5:
 - text: "You want some help with that?"
utter_train_3_6_626_6:
 - text: "Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don’t!"
utter_train_3_6_626_7:
 - text: "Whoa! Are you okay?"
utter_train_3_6_626_8:
 - text: "Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
utter_train_3_6_626_9:
 - text: "It’s the heat.  And-and the humidity."
utter_train_3_6_626_10:
 - text: "That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination."
utter_train_3_6_626_11:
 - text: "Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
utter_train_3_6_626_12:
 - text: "Like you wouldn’t believe.  Wow! This is a great place."
utter_train_3_6_626_13:
 - text: "What do you mean?"
utter_train_3_12_627_0:
 - text: "Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh."
utter_train_6_5_628_0:
 - text: "Oh!"
utter_train_6_5_628_1:
 - text: "Hey, somebody left their keys."
utter_train_6_5_628_2:
 - text: "Ooohh, to a Porsche!"
utter_train_6_5_628_3:
 - text: "Hey Gunther, these yours?"
utter_train_6_5_628_4:
 - text: "Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!"
utter_train_6_5_628_5:
 - text: "Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?"
utter_train_6_5_628_6:
 - text: "Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?"
utter_train_6_5_628_7:
 - text: "There’s a lost and found?  My shoe!"
utter_train_6_5_628_8:
 - text: "You left a shoe here?!"
utter_train_6_5_628_9:
 - text: "Well, I didn’t realize until I got home."
utter_train_6_5_628_10:
 - text: "I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!"
utter_train_6_5_628_11:
 - text: "I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield."
utter_train_6_5_628_12:
 - text: "Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe."
utter_train_6_5_628_13:
 - text: "Great! Thanks."
utter_train_2_2_629_0:
 - text: "Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep."
utter_train_2_2_629_1:
 - text: "Carol, we've been through this before, ok?"
utter_train_2_2_629_2:
 - text: "We have a good time."
utter_train_2_2_629_3:
 - text: "We laugh, we play."
utter_train_2_2_629_4:
 - text: "It's like we're father and son."
utter_train_2_2_629_5:
 - text: "Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person."
utter_train_2_2_629_6:
 - text: "Oh, this is so cute."
utter_train_2_2_629_7:
 - text: "Oh, I got that for him."
utter_train_2_2_629_8:
 - text: "My mommies love me. That's clever."
utter_train_2_2_629_9:
 - text: "Hello?"
utter_train_2_2_629_10:
 - text: "Oh, Hi, Ju——Hi, Jew!"
utter_train_2_2_629_11:
 - text: "Uh huh?"
utter_train_2_2_629_12:
 - text: "Uh huh?"
utter_train_2_2_629_13:
 - text: "Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great."
utter_train_2_2_629_14:
 - text: "See ya then."
utter_train_2_2_629_15:
 - text: "Bye."
utter_train_2_2_629_16:
 - text: "Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
utter_train_2_2_629_17:
 - text: "Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
utter_train_6_18_630_0:
 - text: "Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!"
utter_train_6_18_630_1:
 - text: "Thanks Monica!"
utter_train_6_18_630_2:
 - text: "Does that smell bother you?"
utter_train_6_18_630_3:
 - text: "What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
utter_train_6_18_630_4:
 - text: "Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it."
utter_train_6_18_630_5:
 - text: "I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
utter_train_6_18_630_6:
 - text: "Okay!"
utter_train_6_18_630_7:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_6_18_630_8:
 - text: "Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector."
utter_train_6_18_630_9:
 - text: "Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!"
utter_train_6_18_630_10:
 - text: "Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire."
utter_train_6_18_630_11:
 - text: "No-no, it was the candles."
utter_train_6_18_630_12:
 - text: "It’s very not good leaving candles unattended."
utter_train_6_18_630_13:
 - text: "In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is…  Uhh… Uhh… Okay."
utter_train_6_18_630_14:
 - text: "Well, I have to go now."
utter_train_6_1_631_0:
 - text: "Joey proposed to me."
utter_train_9_1_632_0:
 - text: "Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!"
utter_train_9_1_632_1:
 - text: "Well, I-I said yes."
utter_train_9_1_632_2:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_train_9_1_632_3:
 - text: "Are you crazy?"
utter_train_9_1_632_4:
 - text: "You just had Ross’s baby!"
utter_train_9_1_632_5:
 - text: "It’s-it’s so  inappropriate."
utter_train_9_1_632_6:
 - text: "No, it’s worse than that."
utter_train_9_1_632_7:
 - text: "It’s wrong."
utter_train_9_1_632_8:
 - text: "It’s… It is bigger than  mine!"
utter_train_9_1_632_9:
 - text: "I know."
utter_train_9_1_632_10:
 - text: "You can’t marry him!"
utter_train_9_1_632_11:
 - text: "Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much."
utter_train_9_1_632_12:
 - text: "Well do you love him?"
utter_train_9_1_632_13:
 - text: "Sure."
utter_train_9_1_632_14:
 - text: "Sure?"
utter_train_9_1_632_15:
 - text: "Yeah, I mean whatever."
utter_train_9_1_632_16:
 - text: "Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?"
utter_train_9_1_632_17:
 - text: "No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
utter_train_7_24_633_0:
 - text: "So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?"
utter_train_7_24_633_1:
 - text: "Here comes the bride."
utter_train_7_24_633_2:
 - text: "Oh my God Monica!"
utter_train_7_24_633_3:
 - text: "I wanna wear this everyday."
utter_train_7_24_633_4:
 - text: "You look so beautiful."
utter_train_7_24_633_5:
 - text: "I’m so happy for me."
utter_train_7_24_633_6:
 - text: "Hello?"
utter_train_7_24_633_7:
 - text: "Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?"
utter_train_7_24_633_8:
 - text: "Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine."
utter_train_7_24_633_9:
 - text: "Damnit!"
utter_train_7_16_634_0:
 - text: "I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?"
utter_train_7_16_634_1:
 - text: "Fine."
utter_train_7_16_634_2:
 - text: "Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel."
utter_train_7_16_634_3:
 - text: "And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!"
utter_train_7_16_634_4:
 - text: "No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I"
utter_train_7_16_634_5:
 - text: "Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!"
utter_train_7_16_634_6:
 - text: "And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!"
utter_train_7_16_634_7:
 - text: "Crap!!"
utter_train_7_16_634_8:
 - text: "I gotta go!"
utter_train_8_3_635_0:
 - text: "Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?"
utter_train_8_3_635_1:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_8_3_635_2:
 - text: "Me neither! We have to get in!"
utter_train_8_3_635_3:
 - text: "Just act like you belong."
utter_train_8_3_635_4:
 - text: "Oh my God! Oranges!"
utter_train_8_3_635_5:
 - text: "Shh!  Nice to see you again."
utter_train_8_3_635_6:
 - text: "Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?"
utter_train_8_3_635_7:
 - text: "Yes, of course."
utter_train_8_3_635_8:
 - text: "I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number."
utter_train_8_3_635_9:
 - text: "Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A."
utter_train_7_14_636_0:
 - text: "Okay!"
utter_train_7_14_636_1:
 - text: "Y’know what?"
utter_train_7_14_636_2:
 - text: "I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids."
utter_train_7_14_636_3:
 - text: "All I really needed was a plan."

utter_train_7_14_636_6:

utter_train_7_13_638_5:
 - text: "Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling."
utter_train_7_13_638_6:
 - text: "Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here."
utter_train_7_13_638_7:

utter_train_4_9_640_3:

utter_train_4_9_640_5:

utter_train_4_9_640_6:
 - text: "Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
utter_train_4_9_640_7:
 - text: "I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities."
utter_train_4_9_640_8:
 - text: "Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
utter_train_4_9_640_9:
 - text: "Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost"
utter_train_4_9_640_10:
 - text: "I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
utter_train_4_9_640_11:
 - text: "Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!"
utter_train_4_9_640_12:
 - text: "Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers."
utter_train_4_9_640_13:
 - text: "Yes, I realize that"
utter_train_4_9_640_14:
 - text: "And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean."
utter_train_4_9_640_15:
 - text: "I love working with designers!"
utter_train_4_9_640_16:
 - text: "With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?"
utter_train_7_4_641_0:
 - text: "Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
utter_train_7_4_641_1:
 - text: "Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!"
utter_train_7_5_642_0:
 - text: "Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile."
utter_train_7_5_642_1:
 - text: "I do?"
utter_train_7_5_642_2:
 - text: "Yeah!  All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy."
utter_train_7_5_642_3:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_7_5_642_4:

utter_train_7_8_643_5:

utter_train_7_4_644_2:

utter_train_7_4_644_3:
 - text: "And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?"
utter_train_7_4_644_4:
 - text: "So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing."
utter_train_7_4_644_5:
 - text: "Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls."
utter_train_7_4_644_6:
 - text: "You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God."
utter_train_7_4_644_7:

utter_train_7_4_644_8:
 - text: "Oh Mon, I laughed so hard"
utter_train_7_4_644_9:
 - text: "Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
utter_train_7_4_644_10:
 - text: "Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
utter_train_8_20_645_0:
 - text: "So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?"
utter_train_8_20_645_1:
 - text: "Of course I am!"
utter_train_8_20_645_2:
 - text: "Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot."
utter_train_8_20_645_3:
 - text: "I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes."
utter_train_8_20_645_4:
 - text: "And-and then guess what?"
utter_train_8_20_645_5:
 - text: "The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do."
utter_train_8_20_645_6:
 - text: "Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?"
utter_train_8_20_645_7:
 - text: "No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine."
utter_train_8_20_645_8:
 - text: "Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?"
utter_train_8_20_645_9:
 - text: "I’m going to the bathroom."
utter_train_8_20_645_10:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_8_20_645_11:
 - text: "Now don’t worry! Everything’s gonna be okay."
utter_train_8_20_645_12:
 - text: "It"
utter_train_8_20_645_13:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_8_20_645_14:
 - text: "Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?"
utter_train_8_20_645_15:
 - text: "I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower."
utter_train_8_20_645_16:
 - text: "Not if you were here."
utter_train_7_6_646_0:
 - text: "Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
utter_train_7_6_646_1:
 - text: "Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it’s you!"
utter_train_7_6_646_2:
 - text: "I hope it’s you."
utter_train_7_6_646_3:

utter_train_7_6_646_5:
 - text: "Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!"
utter_train_7_6_646_6:
 - text: "Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other."
utter_train_7_6_646_7:
 - text: "Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine"
utter_train_7_6_646_8:
 - text: "Yes!!! Oh!!"
utter_train_7_6_646_9:
 - text: "Hypothetically!"
utter_train_7_6_646_10:
 - text: "Still."
utter_train_7_6_646_11:
 - text: "If Phoebe were my maid of honor"
utter_train_7_6_646_12:
 - text: "Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset."
utter_train_7_6_646_13:
 - text: "Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea."
utter_train_7_6_646_14:
 - text: "Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?"
utter_train_7_6_646_15:
 - text: "Well that’s the best part. Umm,"
utter_train_7_6_646_16:
 - text: "Wh-why is that the best part?"
utter_train_7_6_646_17:
 - text: "Because then I don’t have to!"
utter_train_7_6_646_18:
 - text: "Well of"
utter_train_7_6_646_19:
 - text: "I’m really not deciding!"
utter_train_7_6_646_20:
 - text: "Fine!"
utter_train_7_6_646_21:
 - text: "Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!"
utter_train_7_19_647_0:
 - text: "If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?"
utter_train_7_10_648_0:
 - text: "It's not just the drum noise."
utter_train_7_10_648_1:
 - text: "Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, Oh my eye!"
utter_train_7_10_648_2:
 - text: "Oh god, my eye!"
utter_train_7_10_648_3:
 - text: "I mean, it is so annoying."
utter_train_7_10_648_4:
 - text: "Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums."
utter_train_7_10_648_5:
 - text: "Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?"
utter_train_7_10_648_6:
 - text: "Maybe on some level."
utter_train_8_12_649_0:
 - text: "Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?"
utter_train_8_12_649_1:
 - text: "No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you."
utter_train_8_12_649_2:

utter_train_7_17_657_16:

utter_train_7_17_657_17:

utter_train_1_20_658_12:

utter_train_1_20_658_16:

utter_train_1_14_659_1:

utter_train_1_14_659_2:

utter_train_1_14_659_3:

utter_train_1_12_661_3:
 - text: "What about the birds?"
utter_train_1_12_661_4:

utter_train_1_12_661_5:

utter_train_1_12_661_6:

utter_train_3_15_664_5:
 - text: "Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth."
utter_train_3_15_664_6:

utter_train_3_15_664_7:
 - text: "Why? What happened to him?"
utter_train_3_15_664_8:

utter_train_4_12_665_2:

utter_train_4_12_665_5:
 - text: "Um-hmm, five actually."
utter_train_4_12_665_6:
 - text: "Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?"
utter_train_4_12_665_7:
 - text: "We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach."
utter_train_4_12_665_8:
 - text: "That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!"
utter_train_4_12_665_9:
 - text: "Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?"
utter_train_4_12_665_10:
 - text: "Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine."

utter_train_4_12_665_12:
 - text: "Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right."
utter_train_4_12_665_13:

utter_train_4_12_665_14:
 - text: "So, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time."
utter_train_4_12_665_15:

utter_train_5_24_667_7:

utter_train_1_21_670_8:
 - text: "No, it is me!"
utter_train_1_21_670_9:
 - text: "Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!"
utter_train_1_21_670_10:
 - text: "Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that."
utter_train_1_21_670_11:

utter_train_1_21_670_14:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_1_21_670_15:
 - text: "They've arrested Monica."
utter_train_9_21_671_0:
 - text: "Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself."
utter_train_9_21_671_1:
 - text: "Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
utter_train_9_21_671_2:
 - text: "No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
utter_train_9_21_671_3:
 - text: "Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y."
utter_train_9_21_671_4:
 - text: "I just..."
utter_train_9_21_671_5:
 - text: "I wrote that out phonetically for you."
utter_train_9_21_671_6:
 - text: "Phonetically?"
utter_train_9_21_671_7:
 - text: "Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this."
utter_train_9_21_671_8:
 - text: "Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
utter_train_9_21_671_9:
 - text: "Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on Days    I had to say Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy."
utter_train_9_21_671_10:
 - text: "Wow. What does"
utter_train_9_21_671_11:
 - text: "No idea!"
utter_train_9_21_671_12:
 - text: "But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means you're gonna get eaten by a bear."
utter_train_9_21_671_13:
 - text: "Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?"
utter_train_9_21_671_14:
 - text: "Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ."
utter_train_9_21_671_15:
 - text: "Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't"
utter_train_9_21_671_16:

utter_train_4_1_672_1:

utter_train_4_1_672_2:
 - text: "Done!"
utter_train_4_1_672_3:
 - text: "You just finished?"
utter_train_4_1_672_4:
 - text: "Well, I wanted to be thorough."
utter_train_4_1_672_5:
 - text: "I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!"
utter_train_4_1_672_6:
 - text: "And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
utter_train_4_1_672_7:
 - text: "So umm, does it?"
utter_train_4_1_672_8:
 - text: "I’m sorry."
utter_train_4_1_672_9:
 - text: "Does it?"
utter_train_4_1_672_10:
 - text: "Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance."
utter_train_4_1_672_11:
 - text: "What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!"
utter_train_4_1_672_12:
 - text: "Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even"
utter_train_4_1_672_13:
 - text: "No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t"
utter_train_4_1_672_14:
 - text: "Are you sure?"
utter_train_4_1_672_15:
 - text: "Oh, sure! I’m sure."
utter_train_6_2_673_0:
 - text: "You got married again."
utter_train_6_2_673_1:
 - text: "Yes."
utter_train_6_2_673_2:
 - text: "So that’s your second marriage in two years."
utter_train_6_2_673_3:
 - text: "Yes, second in two years. Third overall."
utter_train_6_2_673_4:
 - text: "Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client."
utter_train_6_2_673_5:
 - text: "Why don’t you tell me what happened."
utter_train_6_2_673_6:
 - text: "Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk"
utter_train_6_2_673_7:
 - text: "I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?"
utter_train_6_2_673_8:
 - text: "Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do"
utter_train_6_2_673_9:
 - text: "Oh, that’s better then."
utter_train_6_2_673_10:
 - text: "This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled."
utter_train_6_2_673_11:
 - text: "I see. Have you considered therapy?"
utter_train_6_2_673_12:
 - text: "I think just the"
utter_train_6_2_673_13:
 - text: "There are a couple of forms to fill out."
utter_train_6_2_673_14:
 - text: "Easy."
utter_train_6_2_673_15:
 - text: "And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind."
utter_train_6_2_673_16:
 - text: "No problem."
utter_train_6_2_673_17:
 - text: "And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge."
utter_train_6_2_673_18:
 - text: "Ooh!"
utter_train_6_2_673_19:
 - text: "There’s no way to do this without her?"
utter_train_6_2_673_20:
 - text: "‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
utter_train_1_18_674_0:
 - text: "So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones."
utter_train_1_18_674_1:
 - text: "But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
utter_train_1_18_674_2:
 - text: "Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed."

utter_train_7_7_714_5:

utter_train_7_1_715_0:

utter_train_7_7_716_0:

utter_train_4_7_728_6:

utter_train_4_7_728_7:

utter_train_9_21_730_2:
 - text: "You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!"
utter_train_9_21_730_3:

utter_train_3_16_735_0:
 - text: "Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?"

utter_train_1_5_767_0:

utter_train_5_1_771_14:

utter_train_5_1_771_15:

utter_train_6_11_777_9:

utter_train_9_19_792_6:

utter_train_9_19_792_7:

utter_train_9_19_792_18:

utter_train_1_9_793_2:

utter_train_1_9_793_4:
 - text: "I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting."
utter_train_1_9_793_5:
 - text: "Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?"
utter_train_1_9_793_6:

utter_train_5_1_794_3:
 - text: "Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay?"
utter_train_5_1_794_4:

utter_train_5_1_794_5:
 - text: "That’s all!"
utter_train_5_1_794_6:

utter_train_5_1_794_8:

utter_train_9_2_796_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_9_2_796_2:
 - text: "It’s a funny story, actually."
utter_train_9_2_796_3:
 - text: "I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying."
utter_train_9_2_796_4:
 - text: "You fell asleep?"
utter_train_9_2_796_5:

utter_train_9_2_796_11:

utter_train_1_21_797_4:
 - text: "Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using."
utter_train_1_21_797_5:
 - text: "That I was not expecting."
utter_train_1_21_797_6:

utter_train_1_21_797_7:
 - text: "Oh. Thanks."
utter_train_1_21_797_8:
 - text: "No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing"
utter_train_1_21_797_9:
 - text: "Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
utter_train_1_21_797_10:
 - text: "I just can't believe you're in here."
utter_train_1_21_797_11:

utter_train_2_6_799_0:

utter_train_2_6_799_1:
 - text: "Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun."
utter_train_2_6_799_2:
 - text: "Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
utter_train_2_6_799_3:
 - text: "Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?"
utter_train_2_6_799_4:
 - text: "My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally."
utter_train_2_6_799_5:
 - text: "No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now."
utter_train_2_6_799_6:
 - text: "Tho?"
utter_train_3_6_800_0:

utter_train_3_6_800_1:

utter_train_2_6_801_4:

utter_train_2_6_801_6:

utter_train_8_6_803_3:
 - text: "It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me."
utter_train_8_6_803_4:
 - text: "You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity!"
utter_train_8_6_803_5:

utter_train_8_6_803_6:
 - text: "That means nothing to me.  Come on!"
utter_train_4_4_804_0:

utter_train_4_4_804_8:

utter_train_4_4_804_9:

utter_train_4_5_805_3:

utter_train_4_5_805_6:

utter_train_8_2_806_1:

utter_train_8_2_806_2:

utter_train_8_2_806_3:

utter_train_8_2_806_4:

utter_train_8_2_806_7:

utter_train_8_2_806_10:

utter_train_8_2_806_11:
 - text: "So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?"
utter_train_8_2_806_12:

utter_train_8_2_806_13:

utter_train_8_2_806_14:

utter_train_8_2_806_15:

utter_train_6_22_841_10:
 - text: "It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t."

 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_6_22_841_12:

utter_train_6_22_841_20:
 - text: "Yeah, it’s beautiful."
utter_train_6_22_841_21:

utter_train_7_15_842_0:
 - text: "Okay look, I have an idea."
utter_train_7_15_842_1:

utter_train_7_15_842_2:
 - text: "And then whoever does gets the phone."
utter_train_7_15_842_3:
 - text: "All right, first name on the speed dial is mom."
utter_train_7_15_842_4:
 - text: "Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
utter_train_7_15_842_5:
 - text: "Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin."
utter_train_7_15_842_6:
 - text: "Did I use that already today? I’m sorry."
utter_train_7_15_842_7:

utter_train_7_2_843_2:
 - text: "She’s saving the rest for her divorce."
utter_train_7_2_843_3:

 - text: "I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me."
utter_train_4_11_844_3:
 - text: "I will sit with you Dr. Geller."
utter_train_4_11_844_4:
 - text: "Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch."
utter_train_4_11_844_5:

utter_train_4_11_844_6:

utter_train_8_8_854_2:

utter_train_8_8_854_3:
 - text: "Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?"
utter_train_8_8_854_4:

utter_train_6_3_855_2:
 - text: "Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl."

utter_train_6_3_855_4:
 - text: "You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here."
utter_train_6_3_855_5:
 - text: "Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it."
utter_train_6_3_855_6:
 - text: "Why did you take the shower curtain down?"
utter_train_6_3_855_7:
 - text: "That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious."
utter_train_5_13_856_0:
 - text: "Hi."
utter_train_5_13_856_1:
 - text: "Hey man, how did the audition go?"
utter_train_5_13_856_2:
 - text: "Estelle said I didn't get it."
utter_train_5_13_856_3:
 - text: "What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!"
utter_train_5_13_856_4:
 - text: "Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me."
utter_train_5_1_857_0:
 - text: "No!"
utter_train_5_1_857_1:
 - text: "For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around."
utter_train_5_1_857_2:
 - text: "No, from now on, I’m staying in one place."
utter_train_5_1_857_3:
 - text: "Right here."
utter_train_5_1_857_4:
 - text: "Well, it’s getting late."
utter_train_5_1_857_5:
 - text: "Yeah, we’re gonna go."
utter_train_5_1_857_6:
 - text: "Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
utter_train_5_1_857_7:
 - text: "Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
utter_train_5_1_857_8:
 - text: "Yeah, it’s a very large plane."
utter_train_5_1_857_9:
 - text: "That’s cool."
utter_train_5_1_857_10:
 - text: "But, we’ll stay here with you."
utter_train_5_1_857_11:

utter_train_4_13_858_1:
 - text: "They’re not a couple!"
utter_train_4_13_858_2:
 - text: "Oh-okay, I get the game now."
utter_train_4_13_858_3:
 - text: "Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
utter_train_4_13_858_4:
 - text: "Oh yeah!"
utter_train_4_13_858_5:
 - text: "Well okay, so then you’re fine."
utter_train_4_13_858_6:
 - text: "The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone."
utter_train_4_13_858_7:
 - text: "Okay?"
utter_train_4_13_858_8:
 - text: "So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about."
utter_train_4_13_858_9:
 - text: "It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble."
utter_train_4_13_858_10:
 - text: "Really?"
utter_train_4_13_858_11:
 - text: "Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
utter_train_4_13_858_12:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_4_13_858_13:
 - text: "Noooo!!"
utter_train_8_6_859_0:
 - text: "Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe!"
utter_train_8_6_859_1:
 - text: "Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye."
utter_train_8_6_859_2:
 - text: "Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?"
utter_train_8_6_859_3:
 - text: "Umm, nothing. I mean, I’m getting married next week."
utter_train_8_17_860_0:
 - text: "And your breasts! Hmm!!!"
utter_train_8_17_860_1:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_8_17_860_2:
 - text: "Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong."
utter_train_8_17_860_3:
 - text: "But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together."
utter_train_8_17_860_4:
 - text: "So, why don’t we just start over okay?"
utter_train_8_17_860_5:
 - text: "And you can just tell me about yourself."
utter_train_8_17_860_6:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_8_17_860_7:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_8_17_860_8:
 - text: "I write erotic novels, for children."
utter_train_8_17_860_9:
 - text: "What?!"
utter_train_8_17_860_10:
 - text: "They’re wildly unpopular."
utter_train_8_17_860_11:
 - text: "Oh my God!"
utter_train_8_17_860_12:
 - text: "Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D."
utter_train_8_17_860_13:
 - text: "Wow! You do?"
utter_train_8_17_860_14:
 - text: "Yeah,  a Pretty Huge"
utter_train_8_17_860_15:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_1_8_861_0:
 - text: "So, uh, how's she doing?"
utter_train_1_8_861_1:
 - text: "The doctor says it's a matter of hours."
utter_train_1_8_861_2:
 - text: "How-how are you, Mom?"
utter_train_1_8_861_3:
 - text: "Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
utter_train_1_8_861_4:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_1_8_861_5:
 - text: "What's different?"
utter_train_1_8_861_6:
 - text: "Nothing."
utter_train_1_8_861_7:
 - text: "Oh, maybe that's it."
utter_train_1_8_861_8:
 - text: "She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
utter_train_1_8_861_9:
 - text: "Okay, relax, relax."
utter_train_1_8_861_10:
 - text: "We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
utter_train_1_8_861_11:
 - text: "Oh God!"
utter_train_1_8_861_12:
 - text: "The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse."
utter_train_1_8_861_13:
 - text: "Oh!"
utter_train_1_8_861_14:
 - text: "...Yeah, they were gross."
utter_train_1_8_861_15:
 - text: "Oh, you know what I loved?"
utter_train_1_8_861_16:
 - text: "Her Sweet 'n' Los."
utter_train_1_8_861_17:
 - text: "How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
utter_train_1_8_861_18:
 - text: "Not just restaurants, from our house."
utter_train_9_20_862_0:
 - text: "Maybe."
utter_train_9_20_862_1:
 - text: "You can't!"
utter_train_9_20_862_2:
 - text: "Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said."
utter_train_9_20_862_3:
 - text: "In the hall."
utter_train_1_13_863_0:
 - text: "Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping."
utter_train_1_13_863_1:
 - text: "But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose."
utter_train_1_13_863_2:
 - text: "Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
utter_train_1_13_863_3:
 - text: "Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
utter_train_1_13_863_4:
 - text: "That's a good one!"
utter_train_1_13_863_5:
 - text: "Hey, Joe."
utter_train_1_13_863_6:
 - text: "Dad, Ronni's here."
utter_train_1_13_863_7:
 - text: "Huh?"
utter_train_7_20_864_0:
 - text: "So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal."
utter_train_7_20_864_1:
 - text: "Anything at all."
utter_train_7_20_864_2:
 - text: "But these are the three that Monica pre-approved."
utter_train_7_20_864_3:
 - text: "Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
utter_train_7_20_864_4:
 - text: "I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!"
utter_train_7_11_865_0:
 - text: "Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah."
utter_train_7_11_865_1:

utter_train_4_23_866_0:
 - text: "Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!"
utter_train_4_23_866_1:
 - text: "You’ll see."
utter_train_4_23_866_2:
 - text: "I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
utter_train_4_23_866_3:
 - text: "Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles"
utter_train_4_23_866_4:
 - text: "And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and…  You go."
utter_train_4_23_866_5:
 - text: "But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time."
utter_train_4_23_866_6:
 - text: "Really, it’s fine, whatever you want."
utter_train_4_23_866_7:
 - text: "It’s perfect."
utter_train_4_23_866_8:
 - text: "And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain"
utter_train_4_23_866_9:
 - text: "Well then we’ll get wet."
utter_train_4_23_866_10:
 - text: "Ohh. And I don’t even have a date."
utter_train_7_16_867_0:
 - text: "Coming."
utter_train_7_16_867_1:
 - text: "I have a bone to pick with you."
utter_train_7_16_867_2:
 - text: "Uh-oh."
utter_train_7_16_867_3:
 - text: "Yes! Ben learned a little trick."
utter_train_7_16_867_4:
 - text: "Oh yeah? Did he pull the old"
utter_train_7_16_867_5:
 - text: "That’s right! That’s right!"
utter_train_7_16_867_6:
 - text: "Oh that."
utter_train_7_16_867_7:
 - text: "Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!"
utter_train_7_15_868_0:
 - text: "Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!"
utter_train_7_15_868_1:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_7_15_868_2:
 - text: "And if it were true, how"
utter_train_7_15_868_3:
 - text: "Ms. Monroe…  Oh there you go."
utter_train_3_12_869_0:
 - text: "Mark's a genius!"
utter_train_3_12_869_1:
 - text: "Why?! How?! How is he a genius?"
utter_train_3_12_869_2:
 - text: "Look, don't you see what's happening here."
utter_train_3_12_869_3:
 - text: "Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant."
utter_train_3_12_869_4:
 - text: "Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you."
utter_train_3_12_869_5:
 - text: "What am I going to do?"
utter_train_3_12_869_6:
 - text: "Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that."
utter_train_3_12_869_7:
 - text: "All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
utter_train_3_12_869_8:
 - text: "I don't know you guys."
utter_train_3_12_869_9:
 - text: "All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you."
utter_train_3_12_869_10:
 - text: "And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
utter_train_3_12_869_11:
 - text: "And before you know it, she's with him."
utter_train_3_12_869_12:
 - text: "And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'"
utter_train_3_12_869_13:
 - text: "And he'll be all, 'Yes!'"
utter_train_3_12_869_14:
 - text: "And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'"
utter_train_3_12_869_15:
 - text: "And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'"
utter_train_3_12_869_16:
 - text: "And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
utter_train_3_12_869_17:
 - text: "He paints quite a picture doesn't he?"
utter_train_4_22_870_0:
 - text: "This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor."
utter_train_4_22_870_1:
 - text: "Great. Great."
utter_train_4_22_870_2:

utter_train_4_22_870_3:
 - text: "I’ll be there."
utter_train_4_22_870_4:
 - text: "Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
utter_train_4_22_870_5:
 - text: "Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!"
utter_train_4_22_870_6:
 - text: "Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of"

utter_train_4_18_871_0:
 - text: "Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler."
utter_train_4_18_871_1:
 - text: "Oh, come on!"
utter_train_4_18_871_2:
 - text: "Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him."
utter_train_4_18_871_3:
 - text: "Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there."
utter_train_4_18_871_4:
 - text: "Well, Chandler will be there for you too."
utter_train_4_18_871_5:
 - text: "I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there."
utter_train_4_18_871_6:
 - text: "And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot."
utter_train_4_18_871_7:
 - text: "What do ya say? What do ya say?"
utter_train_4_18_871_8:
 - text: "Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names."
utter_train_4_18_871_9:
 - text: "But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk."
utter_train_4_18_871_10:
 - text: "I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!"
utter_train_1_2_872_0:
 - text: "What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well."
utter_train_1_2_872_1:
 - text: "I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!"
utter_train_1_2_872_2:
 - text: "Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..."
utter_train_1_2_872_3:
 - text: "What's that supposed to mean?"
utter_train_1_2_872_4:
 - text: "Nothing! It's an expression."
utter_train_1_2_872_5:
 - text: "No it's not."
utter_train_1_2_872_6:
 - text: "Don't listen to your mother."
utter_train_1_2_872_7:
 - text: "You're independent, and you always have been!"
utter_train_1_2_872_8:
 - text: "Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!"
utter_train_1_2_872_9:
 - text: "And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
utter_train_5_4_873_0:
 - text: "PBS Telethon."
utter_train_5_4_873_1:
 - text: "Hi Joey."
utter_train_5_4_873_2:

 - text: "$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what"
utter_train_5_4_873_5:
 - text: "Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not"
utter_train_5_13_874_0:
 - text: "What kind of problem?"
utter_train_5_13_874_1:
 - text: "Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!"
utter_train_5_13_874_2:
 - text: "Oh my God!"
utter_train_5_13_874_3:
 - text: "Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!"
utter_train_5_13_874_4:
 - text: "Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
utter_train_5_13_874_5:
 - text: "I don't wanna give up the bag."
utter_train_5_13_874_6:
 - text: "I don't have to give up the bag!"
utter_train_5_13_874_7:
 - text: "Do I Rach?"
utter_train_5_13_874_8:
 - text: "Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
utter_train_5_13_874_9:
 - text: "Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it"
utter_train_5_13_874_10:
 - text: "I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag."
utter_train_5_13_874_11:
 - text: "I can't believe I'm hearing this!"
utter_train_5_13_874_12:
 - text: "Wait a minute!"
utter_train_5_13_874_13:
 - text: "Wait a minute!"
utter_train_5_13_874_14:
 - text: "I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial."
utter_train_5_13_874_15:
 - text: "Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
utter_train_5_5_875_0:
 - text: "I think you'll find this room more to your liking."
utter_train_5_5_875_1:
 - text: "Okay, great."
utter_train_5_5_875_2:
 - text: "They say he's only got half a tank left."
utter_train_5_5_875_3:
 - text: "Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!"
utter_train_5_5_875_4:
 - text: "We're switching rooms again."
utter_train_5_5_875_5:
 - text: "What? Why?"
utter_train_5_5_875_6:
 - text: "This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
utter_train_5_5_875_7:
 - text: "Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you."
utter_train_5_5_875_8:
 - text: "Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
utter_train_5_5_875_9:
 - text: "Uh-huh."
utter_train_5_5_875_10:
 - text: "Chandler!"
utter_train_4_20_876_0:
 - text: "Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!"
utter_train_4_20_876_1:

utter_train_4_20_876_2:

utter_train_7_11_877_0:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_7_11_877_1:
 - text: "Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming."
utter_train_7_11_877_2:
 - text: "Oh, I wouldn’t miss this."
utter_train_7_11_877_3:
 - text: "Well, I’m very glad you’re here."
utter_train_7_11_877_4:
 - text: "Oh, you’re such a gentleman.  Come on! We’re going to my place!"
utter_train_7_16_878_0:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_7_16_878_1:
 - text: "Hey-hey."
utter_train_7_16_878_2:
 - text: "So are guys doing okay?"
utter_train_7_16_878_3:
 - text: "Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important."
utter_train_7_4_879_0:
 - text: "Do you have a minute?"
utter_train_7_4_879_1:
 - text: "Well yeah, sure, what’s up?"
utter_train_7_4_879_2:

utter_train_1_1_880_0:
 - text: "Oh really?!"
utter_train_1_1_880_1:
 - text: "Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?"
utter_train_1_1_880_2:
 - text: "Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
utter_train_7_4_881_0:
 - text: "But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay."
utter_train_1_4_882_0:
 - text: "Why’s that?"
utter_train_7_4_883_0:
 - text: "I don’t think I should say."
utter_train_7_4_883_1:
 - text: "Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things."
utter_train_7_4_883_2:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_7_4_883_3:
 - text: "‘Kay."
utter_train_7_4_883_4:

utter_train_1_3_910_6:

utter_train_1_3_910_8:

utter_train_1_3_910_9:

utter_train_1_3_910_10:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_1_3_910_11:
 - text: "..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
utter_train_1_3_910_12:
 - text: "Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
utter_train_1_3_910_13:

utter_train_8_21_911_4:

utter_train_8_21_911_5:

utter_train_5_11_912_5:
 - text: "Are you hot?"
utter_train_5_11_912_6:
 - text: "Okay, it must just be me then."
utter_train_5_11_912_7:

utter_train_5_10_913_0:
 - text: "You're driving me crazy with that!"
utter_train_5_10_913_1:

utter_train_5_10_913_2:
 - text: "Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!"
utter_train_5_10_913_3:
 - text: "Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
utter_train_5_10_913_4:
 - text: "You wanna play?"
utter_train_5_10_913_5:

utter_train_5_10_913_6:
 - text: "And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule."
utter_train_5_10_913_7:
 - text: "Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
utter_train_5_10_913_8:
 - text: "All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?"
utter_train_5_10_913_9:
 - text: "I'm intrigued."
utter_train_5_10_913_10:
 - text: "All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
utter_train_5_10_913_11:
 - text: "Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
utter_train_5_10_913_12:
 - text: "Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
utter_train_5_10_913_13:
 - text: "Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?"
utter_train_5_10_913_14:

utter_train_1_4_914_0:
 - text: "Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?"
utter_train_1_4_914_1:
 - text: "What's that?"
utter_train_1_4_914_2:
 - text: "Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
utter_train_1_23_915_0:
 - text: "I'm sure they'll be here soon."
utter_train_1_23_915_1:
 - text: "Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
utter_train_1_23_915_2:
 - text: "Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station."
utter_train_1_23_915_3:
 - text: "You are really frightening me."
utter_train_1_23_915_4:
 - text: "Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?"
utter_train_1_23_915_5:
 - text: "All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
utter_train_1_23_915_6:
 - text: "All right, honey, time to start pushing."
utter_train_1_23_915_7:
 - text: "But they're not here yet!"
utter_train_1_23_915_8:
 - text: "I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
utter_train_1_23_915_9:
 - text: "Oh, god."
utter_train_8_11_916_0:
 - text: "Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us."
utter_train_8_11_916_1:
 - text: "Yeah, I-I think I suggested that."
utter_train_8_11_916_2:
 - text: "Aw, we-we are so… So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you."
utter_train_8_11_916_3:
 - text: "And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun."
utter_train_8_11_916_4:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_8_11_916_5:
 - text: "I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun."
utter_train_8_11_916_6:
 - text: "It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right?"
utter_train_8_11_916_7:
 - text: "So where-where is it going?"
utter_train_8_11_916_8:
 - text: "Ah!"
utter_train_8_11_916_9:
 - text: "That’s-that’s the real question."
utter_train_8_11_916_10:
 - text: "And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun."
utter_train_8_11_916_11:
 - text: "Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger."
utter_train_8_11_916_12:
 - text: "No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you"
utter_train_8_11_916_13:
 - text: "I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?"
utter_train_8_16_917_0:
 - text: "Y’know what?"
utter_train_8_16_917_1:
 - text: "I am going to take you out to dinner tonight."
utter_train_8_16_917_2:
 - text: "I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers ."
utter_train_8_16_917_3:
 - text: "No?"
utter_train_8_16_917_4:
 - text: "Really?"
utter_train_8_16_917_5:
 - text: "They taste so good."
utter_train_4_18_918_0:
 - text: "Drum roll."
utter_train_4_18_918_1:
 - text: "Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
utter_train_4_18_918_2:
 - text: "Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
utter_train_4_18_918_3:
 - text: "All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
utter_train_4_18_918_4:
 - text: "You’re actually going through with this?"
utter_train_4_18_918_5:
 - text: "Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life."
utter_train_4_18_918_6:
 - text: "Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
utter_train_4_18_918_7:
 - text: "You got problems because of you!"
utter_train_4_18_918_8:
 - text: "Not your name!"
utter_train_4_18_918_9:
 - text: "All right, this has got to stop!"
utter_train_4_18_918_10:
 - text: "Chandler is a great name!"
utter_train_4_18_918_11:
 - text: "In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry."
utter_train_4_18_918_12:
 - text: "I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler."
utter_train_4_19_919_0:
 - text: "Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!"
utter_train_4_19_919_1:
 - text: "It was."
utter_train_3_7_920_0:
 - text: "Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me."
utter_train_3_7_920_1:
 - text: "Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?"
utter_train_3_7_920_2:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_3_7_920_3:
 - text: "Whoa. That was really good."
utter_train_3_7_920_4:
 - text: "Thanks, any suggestions?"
utter_train_8_7_921_0:
 - text: "You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!"
utter_train_8_7_921_1:
 - text: "Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and"
utter_train_8_7_921_2:
 - text: "You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!"
utter_train_8_7_921_3:
 - text: "Well I was just so excited to see you."
utter_train_8_7_921_4:
 - text: "Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird."
utter_train_8_7_921_5:
 - text: "No-no it’s not!"
utter_train_8_7_921_6:
 - text: "I don’t want to lose you!"
utter_train_8_7_921_7:
 - text: "It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird."
utter_train_8_7_921_8:
 - text: "So I guess this is it."
utter_train_8_7_921_9:
 - text: "Yeah.  Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her."
utter_train_8_7_921_10:
 - text: "Yeah, so do you."
utter_train_4_23_922_0:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_4_23_922_1:
 - text: "Hi."
utter_train_4_23_922_2:
 - text: "So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
utter_train_4_23_922_3:
 - text: "Manhattan does not have enough stores."
utter_train_4_23_922_4:
 - text: "Well,"
utter_train_4_23_922_5:
 - text: "You can?"
utter_train_4_23_922_6:
 - text: "Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross."
utter_train_4_23_922_7:
 - text: "Um-hmm."
utter_train_4_23_922_8:
 - text: "And a small piece of chocolate."
utter_train_4_15_923_0:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_4_15_923_1:
 - text: "Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship"
utter_train_4_15_923_2:
 - text: "I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!"
utter_train_4_15_923_3:
 - text: "Right! I just think that this is happening too soon."
utter_train_4_15_923_4:
 - text: "Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time."
utter_train_4_15_923_5:
 - text: "I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
utter_train_4_15_923_6:
 - text: "Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?"
utter_train_4_15_923_7:
 - text: "No! No! Not, Paris."
utter_train_4_15_923_8:
 - text: "Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?"
utter_train_4_15_923_9:
 - text: "Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!"
utter_train_4_15_923_10:
 - text: "When?"
utter_train_4_15_923_11:
 - text: "I don’t know exactly."
utter_train_4_15_923_12:
 - text: "Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes."
utter_train_4_15_923_13:
 - text: "But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow."
utter_train_8_23_924_0:
 - text: "Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that’s him! That’s him!"
utter_train_8_23_924_1:
 - text: "Great! Go get him."
utter_train_8_23_924_2:
 - text: "Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
utter_train_8_23_924_3:
 - text: "He’s not really my type."
utter_train_8_23_924_4:
 - text: "No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything."
utter_train_8_23_924_5:
 - text: "But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks."
utter_train_8_23_924_6:
 - text: "You do attract some stinkers."
utter_train_1_15_925_0:
 - text: "Chandler."
utter_train_1_15_925_1:
 - text: "Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a"
utter_train_1_15_925_2:
 - text: "Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day."
utter_train_1_15_925_3:
 - text: "Oh, listen."
utter_train_1_15_925_4:
 - text: "If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them."
utter_train_1_15_925_5:
 - text: "Really."
utter_train_1_15_925_6:
 - text: "Nothing at all."
utter_train_1_15_925_7:
 - text: "Really."
utter_train_1_15_925_8:
 - text: "Nothing."
utter_train_6_2_926_0:
 - text: "Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
utter_train_6_2_926_1:
 - text: "Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?"
utter_train_6_2_926_2:
 - text: "No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
utter_train_6_2_926_3:
 - text: "Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?"
utter_train_6_2_926_4:
 - text: "No, no, I keep trying, y’know?"
utter_train_6_2_926_5:
 - text: "I can get out, Joey, I have too… but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, …go to the bathroom."
utter_train_6_2_926_6:
 - text: "He may think I’m sick."
utter_train_6_2_926_7:
 - text: "Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with!"
utter_train_6_2_926_8:
 - text: "Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them."
utter_train_6_2_926_9:
 - text: "That’s it."
utter_train_6_2_926_10:
 - text: "Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?"
utter_train_6_2_926_11:
 - text: "Pretty much."
utter_train_6_2_926_12:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_6_2_926_13:
 - text: "Hey Monica!"
utter_train_6_2_926_14:
 - text: "Hi!"
utter_train_6_2_926_15:
 - text: "Hey man, you feeling any better?"
utter_train_6_2_926_16:
 - text: "Joey, we have something to tell you."
utter_train_6_2_926_17:
 - text: "Oh my God! You’re pregnant!"
utter_train_6_1_927_0:
 - text: "Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas."
utter_train_6_1_927_1:
 - text: "What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere."
utter_train_6_1_927_2:
 - text: "Really?!"
utter_train_6_1_927_3:
 - text: "Yeah!"
utter_train_6_1_927_4:
 - text: "Oh my God!—Eh! Well"
utter_train_3_13_928_0:
 - text: "You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn."
utter_train_3_13_928_1:
 - text: "He’s gonna go up to the counter with"
utter_train_3_13_928_2:
 - text: "Yeah."
utter_train_3_13_928_3:
 - text: "I missed this."
utter_train_3_13_928_4:
 - text: "Me too."

utter_train_6_12_933_13:
 - text: "Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther?"
utter_train_6_12_933_14:
 - text: "Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron."
utter_train_6_12_933_15:

utter_train_6_12_933_16:

utter_train_5_23_935_3:
 - text: "Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am"
utter_train_5_23_935_4:
 - text: "This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again."
utter_train_5_23_935_5:
 - text: "So go fix it!"
utter_train_5_23_935_6:
 - text: "Go find Chandler!"
utter_train_5_23_935_7:

utter_train_4_23_936_3:
 - text: "What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?"
utter_train_4_23_936_4:
 - text: "Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him."
utter_train_4_23_936_5:
 - text: "Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back."
utter_train_4_23_936_6:
 - text: "I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!"
utter_train_4_23_936_7:
 - text: "Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does."
utter_train_4_23_936_8:
 - text: "But I have to tell him how I feel!"
utter_train_4_23_936_9:
 - text: "He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
utter_train_4_23_936_10:
 - text: "That’s not why you’re going!"
utter_train_4_23_936_11:
 - text: "You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, Yeah, I love you too, Rach."
utter_train_4_23_936_12:
 - text: "Forget that British chippy."
utter_train_4_23_936_13:
 - text: "Ohh—Do you think he will?!"
utter_train_4_23_936_14:
 - text: "No!"
utter_train_4_23_936_15:
 - text: "Because he’s in love with the British chippy!"
utter_train_4_23_936_16:
 - text: "Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!"
utter_train_4_23_936_17:
 - text: "Y’know, it’s too late!"
utter_train_4_23_936_18:
 - text: "You missed you’re chance!"
utter_train_4_23_936_19:
 - text: "I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over."
utter_train_4_23_936_20:
 - text: "Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, I do."
utter_train_4_23_936_21:
 - text: "I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter."
utter_train_8_12_937_0:
 - text: "So is everybody here?"
utter_train_8_12_937_1:
 - text: "I got here a little early myself."
utter_train_8_12_937_2:
 - text: "Let us begin."
utter_train_8_12_937_3:

utter_train_8_12_937_4:
 - text: "Here."
utter_train_8_12_937_5:
 - text: "Here."
utter_train_8_12_937_6:
 - text: "Now as for the hydrosaurs"
utter_train_3_20_938_0:
 - text: "Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night."
utter_train_3_20_938_1:
 - text: "I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry."
utter_train_3_20_938_2:
 - text: "So, do you think you can forgive me?"
utter_train_3_20_938_3:
 - text: "Great."
utter_train_3_20_938_4:

utter_train_3_20_938_5:

utter_train_3_20_938_8:

utter_train_3_20_938_9:

utter_train_9_1_939_0:

utter_train_9_1_939_1:

utter_train_9_1_939_2:
 - text: "Are you all right?"
utter_train_9_1_939_3:

utter_train_9_1_939_4:
 - text: "Oh my God! He did it?"
utter_train_9_1_939_5:
 - text: "Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?"
utter_train_9_1_939_6:
 - text: "Are you kidding?"
utter_train_9_1_939_7:
 - text: "I’m like the one who talked him into it."
utter_train_9_1_939_8:
 - text: "I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group."
utter_train_9_1_939_9:
 - text: "And you really think this is a good idea?"
utter_train_9_1_939_10:
 - text: "I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people."
utter_train_9_1_939_11:
 - text: "I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right."
utter_train_9_1_939_12:
 - text: "Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so."
utter_train_9_1_939_13:
 - text: "Really?! Even Ross?"
utter_train_9_1_939_14:
 - text: "Especially Ross!"
utter_train_9_1_939_15:
 - text: "Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later."
utter_train_9_1_939_16:
 - text: "Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back."
utter_train_9_1_939_17:
 - text: "There he goes, your fiancée."
utter_train_9_1_939_18:
 - text: "I guess so."
utter_train_9_1_939_19:
 - text: "Although he does play with himself in his sleep."
utter_train_9_1_939_20:
 - text: "I can’t say that I’m surprised."
utter_train_3_6_940_0:
 - text: "Oh, that is so unfortunate."
utter_train_3_6_940_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_3_6_940_2:
 - text: "Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight."
utter_train_3_6_940_3:
 - text: "Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
utter_train_3_6_940_4:
 - text: "You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone."
utter_train_3_6_940_5:
 - text: "Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye."
utter_train_3_6_940_6:
 - text: "Bye-bye!  That’s why I moved out."
utter_train_3_6_940_7:
 - text: "Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore."
utter_train_3_6_940_8:
 - text: "I think on some levels she already knows."
utter_train_3_12_941_0:
 - text: "Night Mon. Night Julio."
utter_train_3_12_941_1:
 - text: "Adiós."
utter_train_3_12_941_2:
 - text: "Look Julio, someone left their book here."
utter_train_3_12_941_3:
 - text: "Ah actually, that is mine."
utter_train_3_12_941_4:
 - text: "Oh yeah, what are you reading?"
utter_train_3_12_941_5:
 - text: "Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?"
utter_train_3_12_941_6:
 - text: "Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?"
utter_train_3_12_941_7:
 - text: "I thought I would, but the translation's no good."
utter_train_3_12_941_8:
 - text: "Your a poet and don't know it."
utter_train_3_12_941_9:
 - text: "Actually I ah, I am a poet."
utter_train_3_12_941_10:
 - text: "Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?"
utter_train_3_12_941_11:
 - text: "Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip."
utter_train_3_12_941_12:
 - text: "Mine?  Right here?"
utter_train_3_12_941_13:
 - text: "I can write an epic poem about this lip."
utter_train_3_12_941_14:
 - text: "How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it."
utter_train_4_10_942_0:
 - text: "Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal."
utter_train_4_10_942_1:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_4_10_942_2:
 - text: "I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win."
utter_train_4_10_942_3:
 - text: "What?"
utter_train_4_10_942_4:
 - text: "We’re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?"
utter_train_4_10_942_5:
 - text: "Are we really in Montreal?!"
utter_train_4_10_942_6:
 - text: "Yes we are. So, coffee?"
utter_train_4_10_942_7:
 - text: "Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
utter_train_4_10_942_8:
 - text: "Oh, no. But it’s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia."
utter_train_7_3_943_0:
 - text: "Okay, here’s batch 22."
utter_train_7_3_943_1:
 - text: "Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s."
utter_train_7_3_943_2:
 - text: "This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
utter_train_7_3_943_3:
 - text: "Let’s give it a shot."
utter_train_7_3_943_4:
 - text: "Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?"
utter_train_7_3_943_5:
 - text: "No, just a Friday night."
utter_train_7_1_944_0:
 - text: "Would she?"
utter_train_7_1_944_1:
 - text: "Would she?  You ate my candy bar!"
utter_train_3_11_945_0:
 - text: "Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
utter_train_3_11_945_1:
 - text: "I know honey, I’m sorry."
utter_train_3_11_945_2:
 - text: "Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in."
utter_train_3_11_945_3:
 - text: "Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
utter_train_3_11_945_4:
 - text: "Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t...."
utter_train_3_11_945_5:
 - text: "I don’t mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
utter_train_3_11_945_6:
 - text: "Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?"
utter_train_3_11_945_7:
 - text: "I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah...."
utter_train_3_11_945_8:
 - text: "It’s not funny, this is actually my job."
utter_train_3_11_945_9:
 - text: "Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus."
utter_train_3_11_945_10:
 - text: "Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here."
utter_train_3_11_945_11:
 - text: "And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger."
utter_train_3_11_945_12:
 - text: "Ah, just one other thing."
utter_train_3_11_945_13:
 - text: "Yes?!"
utter_train_3_11_945_14:
 - text: "I ah, I work at"
utter_train_3_11_945_15:
 - text: "Do you want my pickle?"
utter_train_1_11_946_0:
 - text: "Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?"
utter_train_1_11_946_1:
 - text: "Why?"
utter_train_1_11_946_2:
 - text: "Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
utter_train_1_11_946_3:
 - text: "Oh my God."
utter_train_1_11_946_4:
 - text: "Phoebe."
utter_train_1_11_946_5:
 - text: "Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
utter_train_1_11_946_6:
 - text: "Where?  Ooh, come to Momma."
utter_train_1_11_946_7:
 - text: "He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
utter_train_1_11_946_8:
 - text: "We should do something. Whistle."
utter_train_1_11_946_9:
 - text: "We are not going to whistle."
utter_train_1_11_946_10:
 - text: "Come on, do it."
utter_train_1_11_946_11:
 - text: "No!"
utter_train_1_11_946_12:
 - text: "Do it!"
utter_train_1_11_946_13:

utter_train_1_11_946_14:

utter_train_1_11_946_15:
 - text: "Woo-woo!"
utter_train_1_11_946_16:
 - text: "I can't believe you did that!"
utter_train_8_21_947_0:
 - text: "Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s."
utter_train_8_21_947_1:
 - text: "Still?"
utter_train_8_21_947_2:
 - text: "I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
utter_train_8_21_947_3:
 - text: "I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myself again."
utter_train_8_21_947_4:
 - text: "Either eat it, or be in it."
utter_train_8_21_947_5:
 - text: "Spoon?  So, what do you think?"
utter_train_8_21_947_6:
 - text: "I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal."
utter_train_8_21_947_7:
 - text: "Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. there’s a new class comin’ in."
utter_train_8_21_947_8:
 - text: "Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?"
utter_train_8_21_947_9:
 - text: "I can."
utter_train_8_21_947_10:
 - text: "Okay, go ahead."
utter_train_8_21_947_11:
 - text: "Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
utter_train_8_21_947_12:
 - text: "That’s very good, what’s your name?"
utter_train_8_21_947_13:

utter_train_3_1_973_15:

utter_train_2_6_976_9:

utter_train_2_6_976_10:
 - text: "Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."

utter_train_3_12_977_3:

utter_train_3_12_977_5:
 - text: "You are totally jealous."
utter_train_3_12_977_6:

utter_train_3_12_977_7:

utter_train_3_12_977_13:
 - text: "Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know."
utter_train_3_12_977_14:
 - text: "Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
utter_train_3_6_978_0:
 - text: "I can’t believe you came back."
utter_train_3_6_978_1:

utter_train_3_11_980_2:

utter_train_3_11_980_4:
 - text: "What the hell?s a matter with you?"
utter_train_3_11_980_5:
 - text: "How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?"
utter_train_3_11_980_6:
 - text: "Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba."
utter_train_3_11_980_7:
 - text: "All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person."
utter_train_3_11_980_8:
 - text: "At least you know her name."
utter_train_3_11_980_9:
 - text: "You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
utter_train_3_11_980_10:
 - text: "What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?"
utter_train_3_11_980_11:
 - text: "Where in Cuba?"
utter_train_6_14_981_0:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_6_14_981_1:

utter_train_6_6_982_5:
 - text: "Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?"
utter_train_6_6_982_6:
 - text: "A four and a nine."
utter_train_6_6_982_7:
 - text: "You’re kidding right?"
utter_train_6_6_982_8:
 - text: "No. Why?"
utter_train_6_6_982_9:
 - text: "Well that’s a full cup!"
utter_train_6_6_982_10:
 - text: "Damn! I am good at Cups!"
utter_train_7_24_983_0:
 - text: "What? Why? Where are you?"
utter_train_7_24_983_1:
 - text: "I’m still on the set!"
utter_train_7_24_983_2:
 - text: "Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!"
utter_train_7_24_983_3:
 - text: "I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this."
utter_train_7_24_983_4:
 - text: "Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister."
utter_train_7_24_983_5:
 - text: "No! No, I’m the minister! Alright, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now."
utter_train_7_24_983_6:
 - text: "Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
utter_train_7_24_983_7:
 - text: "Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!"
utter_train_5_22_984_0:
 - text: "Oh hey Joey! What's up?"
utter_train_5_22_984_1:
 - text: "I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?"
utter_train_5_22_984_2:
 - text: "Yeah, I've been around."
utter_train_5_22_984_3:
 - text: "Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
utter_train_5_22_984_4:
 - text: "Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees."
utter_train_5_22_984_5:
 - text: "Great! Problem solved!"
utter_train_6_4_985_0:
 - text: "Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance."
utter_train_6_4_985_1:
 - text: "All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control."
utter_train_6_4_985_2:
 - text: "Why?"
utter_train_6_4_985_3:
 - text: "Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town."
utter_train_6_4_985_4:
 - text: "Bastard!"
utter_train_5_14_986_0:
 - text: "You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh!"
utter_train_5_14_986_1:
 - text: "All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!"
utter_train_5_14_986_2:
 - text: "Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it."
utter_train_5_14_986_3:
 - text: "Oh, I can't believe it!"
utter_train_5_14_986_4:
 - text: "I mean I think it's great!"
utter_train_5_14_986_5:
 - text: "For him."
utter_train_5_14_986_6:
 - text: "She might be able to do better."
utter_train_5_14_986_7:
 - text: "Hey guys!"
utter_train_5_14_986_8:
 - text: "Joey! Come here! Come here!"
utter_train_5_14_986_9:
 - text: "Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler."
utter_train_5_14_986_10:
 - text: "You mean how they're friends and nothing more?"
utter_train_5_14_986_11:
 - text: "No. Joey, she"
utter_train_5_14_986_12:
 - text: "Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?"
utter_train_5_14_986_13:
 - text: "Yes, but y'know what?"
utter_train_5_14_986_14:
 - text: "It doesn't matter who knows what."
utter_train_5_14_986_15:
 - text: "Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!"
utter_train_5_14_986_16:
 - text: "Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!"
utter_train_5_8_987_0:
 - text: "It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
utter_train_7_21_988_0:
 - text: "Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things."
utter_train_7_21_988_1:
 - text: "You really think it would be that different?"
utter_train_7_21_988_2:
 - text: "How could it not be?"
utter_train_7_21_988_3:
 - text: "I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids."
utter_train_7_21_988_4:
 - text: "And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a"
utter_train_7_21_988_5:
 - text: "Well, things change."
utter_train_7_21_988_6:
 - text: "I don’t want them to move to a"
utter_train_7_21_988_7:
 - text: "It’ll be okay Joe."
utter_train_7_11_989_0:
 - text: "Its still there!"
utter_train_7_11_989_1:
 - text: "Mrs. Braverman must be out."
utter_train_7_11_989_2:
 - text: "She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months."
utter_train_7_11_989_3:
 - text: "By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
utter_train_7_11_989_4:
 - text: "No that could kill her."
utter_train_7_11_989_5:
 - text: "Well, we don’t want that."
utter_train_7_11_989_6:
 - text: "No, so we’re protecting her."
utter_train_7_11_989_7:
 - text: "But we should take it."
utter_train_7_11_989_8:
 - text: "But we should move quick."
utter_train_7_11_989_9:
 - text: "Why?"
utter_train_7_11_989_10:
 - text: "Because I think I just heard her moving around in there."
utter_train_7_11_989_11:
 - text: "Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!"
utter_train_1_13_990_0:
 - text: "Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
utter_train_1_13_990_1:
 - text: "Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear."
utter_train_1_13_990_2:
 - text: "Well, you're gonna."
utter_train_1_13_990_3:
 - text: "I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
utter_train_1_13_990_4:
 - text: "Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
utter_train_1_13_990_5:
 - text: "Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women."
utter_train_1_13_990_6:
 - text: "And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?"
utter_train_1_13_990_7:
 - text: "Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
utter_train_1_13_990_8:
 - text: "Hey, you're not him."
utter_train_1_13_990_9:
 - text: "You're you."
utter_train_1_13_990_10:
 - text: "When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
utter_train_1_13_990_11:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_1_13_990_12:
 - text: "No."
utter_train_1_13_990_13:
 - text: "You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business."
utter_train_1_13_990_14:
 - text: "Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!"
utter_train_1_13_990_15:
 - text: "And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say No thanks, I'm married."
utter_train_1_13_990_16:
 - text: "You really think so?"
utter_train_1_13_990_17:
 - text: "Yeah. I really do."
utter_train_1_13_990_18:
 - text: "Thanks, Chandler."
utter_train_1_13_990_19:
 - text: "Get off!"
utter_train_8_21_991_0:
 - text: "Hi."
utter_train_8_21_991_1:
 - text: "Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?"
utter_train_8_21_991_2:
 - text: "When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
utter_train_8_21_991_3:
 - text: "And the cream?"
utter_train_8_21_991_4:
 - text: "Cheese makes me thirsty."
utter_train_8_21_991_5:
 - text: "Okay. Let’s move on."
utter_train_8_21_991_6:
 - text: "All right."
utter_train_8_21_991_7:
 - text: "Oh! Something smells good over at Monica’s station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You’ve never made this before?"
utter_train_8_21_991_8:
 - text: "Oh no!"
utter_train_8_21_991_9:
 - text: "I don’t know anything about cooking."
utter_train_8_21_991_10:
 - text: "I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
utter_train_8_21_991_11:
 - text: "Well, hats off to the chef."
utter_train_8_21_991_12:
 - text: "I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
utter_train_8_21_991_13:
 - text: "The chef!"
utter_train_8_21_991_14:
 - text: "That’s right."
utter_train_1_13_992_0:
 - text: "Hey, Pheebs."
utter_train_1_13_992_1:
 - text: "Hey."
utter_train_1_13_992_2:
 - text: "How's it going?"
utter_train_1_13_992_3:
 - text: "Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys."
utter_train_1_13_992_4:
 - text: "So what's going on?"
utter_train_1_13_992_5:
 - text: "Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
utter_train_1_13_992_6:
 - text: "I dunno, there's just something about..."
utter_train_1_13_992_7:
 - text: "Basically we just feel that he's..."
utter_train_1_13_992_8:
 - text: "We hate that guy."
utter_train_1_13_992_9:
 - text: "Yeah. Hate him."
utter_train_1_13_992_10:
 - text: "We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
utter_train_1_13_992_11:
 - text: "Uh-huh."
utter_train_1_13_992_12:
 - text: "Okay."
utter_train_1_13_992_13:
 - text: "Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
utter_train_1_13_992_14:
 - text: "...No, we hate him."
utter_train_1_13_992_15:
 - text: "We're sorry."
utter_train_4_8_993_0:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_4_8_993_1:
 - text: "Hey!"
utter_train_4_8_993_2:
 - text: "What are you doing?"
utter_train_4_8_993_3:
 - text: "I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt."
utter_train_5_5_994_0:
 - text: "Yes that was mine."
utter_train_5_5_994_1:
 - text: "Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there."
utter_train_5_5_994_2:
 - text: "Yes that would have made more sense."
utter_train_5_5_994_3:
 - text: "Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!"
utter_train_5_5_994_4:
 - text: "All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time."
utter_train_5_5_994_5:
 - text: "And whatever you say, I'll believe ya."
utter_train_5_5_994_6:
 - text: "Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?"
utter_train_5_10_995_0:
 - text: "Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?"
utter_train_5_10_995_1:
 - text: "Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball."
utter_train_4_23_996_0:
 - text: "She said what?"
utter_train_4_23_996_1:
 - text: "She said, If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
utter_train_4_23_996_2:
 - text: "Postpone it?"
utter_train_4_23_996_3:
 - text: "Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
utter_train_4_23_996_4:
 - text: "Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?"
utter_train_4_23_996_5:
 - text: "This isn’t right."
utter_train_4_23_996_6:
 - text: "I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right."
utter_train_4_23_996_7:
 - text: "I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?"
utter_train_4_23_996_8:
 - text: "Don’t you point your pants at me!"
utter_train_4_23_996_9:
 - text: "We have no choice!"
utter_train_4_23_996_10:
 - text: "Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand?"
utter_train_4_23_996_11:
 - text: "This is our wedding I’m talking about."
utter_train_4_23_996_12:
 - text: "The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married."
utter_train_4_23_996_13:
 - text: "So what are you saying? It’s now or never?"
utter_train_4_23_996_14:
 - text: "No. I’m saying it’s now."
